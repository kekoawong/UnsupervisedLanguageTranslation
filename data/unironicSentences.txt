I suspect atheists are projecting their desires when they imagine Obama is one of their number . Does anyone remember the crazy preacher with whom he was associated ? I can understand a career politician in the USA needing to feign belief to get elected , but for that purpose I 'd imagine a more vanilla choice of church . He 's not an atheist . He 's not a liberal either .
It 's funny how the arguments the shills are making here are still so close to the racist remarks the GOP has already admitted to . Always attacking `` lazy minorities and young people. `` & gt ; “ [ i ] f it hurts a bunch of college kids that ’ s too lazy to get up off their bohunkus [ sic ] and get a photo ID , so be it , ” and “ if it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that wants the government to give them everything , so be it . ” “ the law is going to kick the Democrats in the butt . ”
We are truly following the patterns of how the mandarins took over empires , not because of the sword , but because control of the endless paper , and regulations , that do more to stagnate most people 's lives , then to do anything productive . But then because they do n't see what else they can do , they write up even more laws and regulations , that either do nothing , or hinder more freedom and production .

& gt ; The essence of the entitlement state is government giving away free stuff . Hence Obamacare would provide insurance for 30 million uninsured , while giving everybody tons of free medical services — without adding “ one dime to our deficits , ” promised Obama . & gt ; & gt ; This being inherently impossible , there had to be a catch . Now we know it : hidden subsidies . Toss millions of the insured off their plans and onto the Obamacare “ exchanges , ” where they would be forced into more expensive insurance packed with coverage they don ’ t want and don ’ t need — so that the overcharge can be used to subsidize others .
The tides of change are on the move . Legalizing pot will do nothing to change my smoking habits , but I am excited for the potential economic upside .
To be fair , there are many who are only bigots because their religion tells them to be bigots . That described me when I was a Christian . Sadly , I too believed homosexuality was a sin . I spoke out against it when the subject came up . I was a bigot . When I deconverted , and I no longer had a God to tell me it was wrong , my bigotry evaporated along with my religious beliefs . I had no reason to think homosexuality was anything but perfectly normal . For many , religion is the reason for the bigotry , and not simply the excuse .
I used to pirate videogames , then Steam came along and i stopped . I used to pirate music , then Spotify came along and i stopped .

But i pirate a LOT fewer movies now . I still pirate TV shows which are n't on Netflix , because fuck waiting sometimes a year or so to watch stuff that 's aired in the USA .

& gt ; 2 ) Churches Are Anti-Science . & gt ; Despite growing change , many churches are still legalistically anti-evolution , anti-global warming , anti-pro-choice , anti-environment , anti-psychology , anti-medicine , and anti-women ( to name just a few ) I just do n't understand how anyone who 's curious and inquisitive would prefer to repeat secular `` common sense '' inside of church instead of trying to go deeper into the Bible 's and the Church 's fascinanting philosophy . Why would such person be called an intellectual ? Also , does an intellectual worships science ? If you go to any humanities college , there 's no worship of science going on . So I was a little disappointed with the article . I do feel like a stranger in churches . But not because people have any prejudice against me . Every intellectual is a little rebelious . That 's not a Christian quality .
The only people offended by the Redskins are white liberals and Obama .

It sounds to me like this is simply a brief exchange concerning PR strategy . They 're both agreeing that sticking to the message of openness to compromise while democrats are saying that they will not accept a compromise on implementation of the affordable care act presents an opportunity to appear more pragmatic and reasonable ( exactly the face republicans need going forward ) . I lean a little liberal myself , but I would have to agree with others who have said that this is not a gaffe by any stretch of the imagination . This clip just shows two politicians agreeing that they would like to be seen as the `` good guys , '' no surprises , and certainly no harm , there .
I 'm curious whether McAuliffe 's victory changes reddit 's stance on money in politics , considering he is a guy who has never been elected to public office and is riding a wave of out of state money ?

So the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating , since any deflation is catastrophic ? Because that is often the conclusion of the Keynesian/new economics argument that you began . People need wealth to trade for other wealth . But when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates ( allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to ) and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting , the balance is thrown off . There is new money in the system , but the same amount of wealth . It works great at first , creating a boom . But eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of stuff , and you have a contraction , or a bust . It is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting , since what you said is essentially true . If people have more money , they can spend more money . But what you have not taken into account is what French economist Frederic Bastiat called `` what is seen and what is unseen. `` I would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin it 's implications . I used to think along the same lines as you until I read it . I would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs . New businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation . However you seem to be ( possibly indirectly ) arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this . As someone actively trying to start a business right now , I can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan , as I only intend to sell my product for $ 3-10 , which is what I believe the market can handle . Jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though . Just one quick example out of many : if I want to set up my business as an LLC in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection , in Massachusetts I have to pay a $ 500 registration fee . Then every single year after that , I would have to pay an additional $ 500 fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state . This annual report serves noones bennefit but the states , I might add . If you want new jobs to be created quickly , remove all the regulations hindering small business development . And if you do n't believe that it 's that bad , I would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself .
I think the more damning idea is ... `` Everything we do in this body should be about messaging to win back the Senate , ” Sessions said . I mean , I assume he is using hyperbole , but the idea that the main goal of the House is to deliver the Senate to the Republicans is absolutely awful . I would really , really hope that `` small government Conservatives '' would have a problem with that , as well as Libertarians and Democrats ... and anyone other than a team-minded politician .
Virginia does n't have party registration . So of course ultra far right republicans somehow think they are `` independents '' . It also means all primaries are open primaries . This is why Cooch supporters changed it to a caucus late in the game , he would n't last in an open primary . Edit : Meant to say convention . Same idea essentially , choosing without a broad vote .
& gt ; If there are other laws that do , that has nothing to do with Obamacare . You should read the article . Second paragraph : & gt ; The 1993 National Voter Registration Act ( NVRA ) , known as the Motor Voter law , says that DMVs and other state agencies that provide public assistance have to provide voter registration services . The reason the PPACA is involved is because it creates new federal and state agencies that provide public assistance . & gt ; Besides , why is it Bad to encourage people to vote ? High voter turnout usually results in elections going against Republicans . This is why they try so hard to disenfranchise voters every election cycle .

But what can be done ? `` Too big to fail '' is a very real thing , especially now , with so many people retiring and set to retire over the next 10 years or so , and so much of their retirement invested in the stock market . You take down the major banks and force a massive market correction , and you essentially wipe out the life savings of millions of people . There 's a reason the fed is pumping so much money into the stock market , trying to spin up share prices in any way possible : because we do n't really have any choice .
I was thinking during this whole shutdown that Republicans were committing political suicide . However , I logged on to Facebook only to see my bat shit crazy family members posting statuses about how `` Obama is shutting down the government like a whiny child because he has n't got his way '' and realized that I no longer believe in democracy .
& gt ; its the Constitution . I know nothing about this case and how it was ruled . But it was the court that blocked it , not the constitution . A court could rule that eating ice cream is unconstitutional , that does n't mean the constitution had anything to do with the ruling . Unless you would like to cite directly what part of the constitution ( which does n't mention education at all ) relates to what he was trying to do there .
Hmmmm ... It was next to impossible for me to realize king obama actually apologized for his lies . For him take this advice would make my head explode . Did Bill even think about who would then pay for this new healthcare system before he opened his mouth ? People wanting to keep their plans are undoubtedly the ones paying taxes ( thus obamacare ) to begin with . Democrats are scumbags when it comes to sticking their hands in other peoples pockets .

Wow , uh , this guy really does n't understand what he 's talking about at all , does he ? And , unfortunately , people like this guy are the reason why Morgan Freeman does not believe in God - because people like this guy force you to choose between science and God . Here is a excerpt from an interview with Morgan Freeman : -- -- -- -- -- Q : Did we invent God ? A : Yes . Q : So there is n't a God up in the sky somewhere . We came up with God ourselves . A : Well , here 's a scientific question : Has anybody ever seen hard evidence ? What we get is theories from our earlier prophets . Now , people who think that God invented us think that the Earth ca n't be more than 6,000 years old . So I guess it 's a question of belief . My belief system does n't support a creator as such , as we can call God , who created us in His/Her/Its image . -- -- -- -- -- There are millions of people who believe that `` God invented us , '' and also think that the idea of a 6,000 year old Earth is ridiculous . But those people are drowned out by folks who find that things like evolution uncomfortable and thus reject it , making the faith look foolish by association . If the loudest proponents of Christianity presented the case for God in a reasonable fashion , and admitted that theism is a matter of faith , I think we 'd have far fewer atheists than we have by having those proponents insist that we have empirical proof of God , and reject science because it does n't fit the narrow worldview they 've created for Him .
yup , do n't even remember the last time I pirated a video game . Give me the same service ( instant , sales ) for TV/movies and I 'll stop downloading . 80 $ for the DVD of one TV season is not reasonable .

Depending on their policy they may have limitations to technology coverage but their agent should have built riders & amp ; managed umbrella policies to take these things into account .

The further upside is that if the minimum retirement age for benefits was raised 2 years , the fund would be solvent well into the 2050 's .
Former insurance lawyer here : it 's entirely possible that the insurance would only cover the fair market value of the destroyed equipment . That 's often substantially less than the replacement cost , because the fair market value of a 5 year old computer is pretty low , but you ca n't easily buy a 5 year old computer as a replacement . Other things could have happened as well .

My favorite illustration of this : January of this year , he wrote an opt-ed in the Washington Times saying we should use drones to protect us from illegals within our borders February of this year , he did that insane filibuster over whether Obama could use drones within our borders March of this year , he said , `` If someone comes out of a liquor store with a weapon and 50 dollars in cash , I do n't care if a drone kills him or a policeman kills him. ``

This is exactly why I do n't want her as a President for 4-8 years and why I want her as a Senator for the next 10 - 15 . Not that I would n't vote for her if she ran because , as of right now , I think she would be great . I just wish to stretch out that greatness a bit longer and hopefully have a few more like-minded Senators elected to work alongside of her .
Their ideology is homophobic and sexist .

This is such a naive view . Money is literally the most valuable thing you can possess . As long as money represents the value of literally every good and service that you can buy with it , then money will continue to rule every facet of our society , from labor to trade to rule of law to politics and everything in between . It is profoundly frustrating as money has absolutely no intrinsic value of its own ( except as perhaps kindling for fire because it 's made out of a combustible material ) , but we 're the ones who give money so much value in our lives . Money does rule over us , and always will , until we move into a true post-scarcity society . And even then we 'll probably still allow money to rule over us , because for the most part we are all pretty dumb .
I read the introduction -- & gt ; It is very interesting so far .

I do n't know about a jar of honey , but when I look at the ridiculous infrastructure we 've set up here in the US and the resources wasted in the name of `` homeland security '' , I 'd have to agree that Bin Laden may very well have won the bigger war . The 60 minutes story last night about the trials that are going to be held in Guantanamo after 12 years so that `` justice '' can be dispensed shows me just how fucked up we 've become after those attacks . We are still terrified apparently and since 9/11 was an act of terrorism ...

Definitely worth listening to . This topic is clearly divisive , and its interesting to see what those legal minds think . Of course they 've all done and said things that make me shake my head , but I do have respect .

Well would we expect anything different from this administration that has been leading us down the crapper . Are the people going to do anything about it ? I think not , they have allowed all the bullshit to continue this long and they will allow it to continue on . In fact if anyone in this sub reddit surprised that these people we 're allowed to come into the country and all on the taxpayers backs . I think this is only the beginning . Start arming yourselves people .
This reminds me of when Catholic adoption agencies shut their doors rather than be forced to follow non-discrimination laws . Only this time it 's so big that I doubt they 'd be willing to shut down rather than give in . It will be interesting to see what happens . My boss 's religion really should n't be able to affect my healthcare . Edit ; whitehouse . gov/the-press-office/2012/02/10/fact-sheet-women-s-preventive-services-and-religious-institutions Ah , so the issue is these are n't considered to be religious enough to get this special treatment . Hopefully they can get that fixed .
When right wingers whine that the USA has some of the highest corporate tax rates in the world , I remind them that these `` rates '' are like the manufactures suggested retail prices for mattresses ...... nobody actually pays it , everyone gets a special `` sale '' price .

Showed this list to my mom ( a conservative Christian who fights for and would have fought for all those things ) and got grounded . Worth it .
I agree on principle , as an Illinoisan . One of my college roommates , at the time , was on Obama 's senate campaign , as an intern . I got to hear all about him and how he 'd be a great senator for Illinois . 4 years later , he quits his job before he finishes a single term , which was mostly spent campaigning for President .
They would n't close the plants if an alternative source was n't in place and it appears they 're being replace by natural gas ... cheaper , more efficient , and cleaner . How is this with complaining about ? One plant closes , another opens with lower operational cost . Some jobs will be lost , but that happens when your business model fails to be competitive .
Why only rely on a single mechanism of control when you could layer dozens over each other ?
I highly doubt that speech will do him in if he runs .
Why not both ? Forest loss has been halted or reversed in most of the developed world . Tree farms are now very sustainable , and the logging industry in the US is a leading proponent of environmental protection .
This can not be said too often . I 'm Jewish and I know of no American Jew who has anything but contempt for Netanyahu and other Israeli right-wingers . It is the American Christian hard-right who supports him , not us .
Oh , for fuck 's sake . Does everything have to be about race with them ?

Never ever thought I would see a bunnyhug mentioned on reddit . Only in Saskatchewan .
If they keep this up I might actually start watching Fox again .
Republicans see the impending shut down the same as they saw the impending sequester ; as a crisis they wo n't have to take responsibility for that can be used for leverage . For example , if the GOP said , `` Give us what we want or we 'll defund the government and force it to shut down , '' we could easily point to their deliberate act of defunding the government as a terrorist act . Instead , they seek out a crisis that will occur if they do nothing at all . Failure to act is not the same as acting . This way , they can say , `` its not our fault the government shut down . We put out a balanced budget , just no one wanted it. `` Of course , no sane person will want their idea of a balanced budget but that 's left for pundits and analysts to explain and the only people watching them are the same ones who already know . The majority of people are not politically minded and do n't tune in all night to political shows or read political periodicals . As they see it , they are in the cat bird seat . Do nothing , and you can blame the resulting crisis on Obama ( why not , they blame everything on him already ) OR get their way in exchange for preventing the shut down . So , they are not saying , `` give me everything in your house or Im going to burn it down , '' they are instead saying , `` give me everything in your house or I wo n't douse it with my water . Its mine and I dont have to give it to you. `` It is NOT right , and most will consider it tantamount to the same thing , but Im trying to explain that it is a very carefully strategized tactic to give them an out from responsibility .

It makes it worse that he did n't even say , `` guilty as charged , I will make sure it never happens again. `` Instead , he first blamed his critics and called them `` hacks , '' and then , upon being caught again he threw his speech writers under the bus and blamed it on them .
That 's assuming of course the confession is not made under duress and the killer has a fair trial . Neither of which is guaranteed .
I thought we had separation of church and state , where you 're not supposed to lecture politics from the pulpit . If liberal leaning churches get to advocate for Obamacare , a law passed only by Democrats , then the conservative congregations get to denounce it . Or is religion allowed a pass on political messaging , as long as it is in favor of liberal ideas ? Then we have hypocrisy .

Hmm so /r/conservative should n't be upset over this like they were for the national bill since this is done by a state and they love `` states rights '' Oops nope , they only like `` states rights '' when it discriminates and will just say `` Discrimination is already illegal and why is sexual orientation coming up at work anyway '' which just shows how little they understand the issue . Or more likely they are just dicks who want anyone different than them to suffer .
What is considered rich people ? Is the counter arguing that people who provide capital create jobs ?

Serious question here : Why is gold considered more `` reliable '' ? Is n't it just like other currency , in that it 's worth comes from our collective decision to assign it worth ? Correct me if wrong , but it has no real value of its own besides the `` ooo , pretty '' factor , and some minor use in electronics etc . If economies collapse , gold is worthless , right ? You ca n't eat it . You ca n't make shelter with it ( unless you have a whole freakin ' lot ) . It is not suitable as a defensive weapon . Basically , you 'd starve with your pile of gold , while those that have shelter , food , and weapons would be trading with each other to survive . So gold = paper money , pretty much ... right ?

& gt ; Atheism/Theism had nothing to do with the attack . How do you know ? Is n't it kind of hypocritical to say this incident certainly had nothing to do with atheism when the sub here is quick to attribute every bad action by a religious believer to his religion ? It looks as if you 're moving the goalpost : When there 's a claim atheists here do n't like , they say : `` Oh , atheism is merely the lack of belief , it ca n't inspire anything ! `` On the other hand , they do n't shy away from anti-theistic claims . When someone shouts `` Ah , this is what religion does to people ! `` , nobody reponds by saying : `` This does n't follow from atheism , you ca n't say that in here. `` When you 're cultivating a culture of anger , hate , and stereotyping , is it really a surprise if some people start to feel motivated to fight the foe ?
Yet another great rant about how Christians suck at being Christians .
I do n't know how any progressive is n't pissed off about this bill . I know I am and I consider myself pretty far left .

Modern Conservatives and their mentally challenged cousins , libertarians , take their Austrian Economic ideology as doctrine , and would run with it until it drove the entire country into a backwards feudal state . The last moderate Republican president we had who realized we had to spend or cut spending , or tax or cut taxes when it was necessary was George Bush Sr. Because he did n't embrace the unpatriotic philosophy of `` TAXES ARE THEFT DURP '' the loons on the right abandoned him and lost what should have been a fairly easy reelection ( the guy was an incumbent who won and finished a large war for God 's sake ) Democrats have their own ideologies , but they realize when going against their ideology can be sound economic policy ( payroll tax holiday as a recent example ) .

I think conditions have changed in the US , such that we no longer need fear the prospect of a Republican resurgence necessitating excessive filibuster protections for Democratic Minorities , going forward . We should go nuclear , in every regard , across the board , to stomp down the Republicans , so the present administration can surge forward with appointments , legislation and policy changes that are so urgently needed ... which will serve to enhance the viability of the administration and the Party , in terms of hope and change , going into the next elections . With sufficient more or less relatively progressive Democratic Super Majorities ( Not rotten with Blue Dog ilk ) in the House and Senate , relatively modest and obvious electoral , campaign finance and media reforms will become feasible , to curtail Republican dirty tricks and prevent them from ever again stealing an election to regain Majorities . A far more viable democracy would emerge , such that prospects of a single-party dictatorship , or capture by monopoly corporate fascist interests , would also be curtailed by the popular democratic will .

The simplest way to explain this is that the fluid injection and extraction used in hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) can induce or trigger ( not cause directly ) earthquakes .

What a condescending , pretentious little brat . I am neither old nor white , but I think there 's plenty of room in the Republican Party for values-voters who are firm in their convictions and believe that an age-old , hallowed vestige that has survived for over a millenia - and is , as Pat Buchanan would have it , the cinderblock of every good civilization - should not be reconstructed or demolished without so much as the batting of an eyelash . For every Jon Stewart-worshipping , dope-smoking millenial we mesmerize with our modernistic , reinvented , `` new and improved '' charms , we lose a folksy , tradition-revering , flag-waving Hank Hill or Charlie church-going , evangelical Christian . Is this shallow-minded , shortsighted , moral degenerate really going to allow the Cultural Marxists , who have already been permitted to hijack every major institution in sight , to frame the debate for us , rather than fight in the trenches for the divinely ordained , sacrosanct moral order that holds society together ? There 's a reason heteronormative marriage has withstood the test of time : dual gender parenting - a mom and a dad - provides a balanced , `` best of both worlds '' approach to the upbringing of our youth . It sows the seeds and lays the groundwork for ordered liberty , civil government , and moral restraints on the insatiable appetite for avarice and sin . It is where division of labor , separation of responsibilities , disciplinary action against unruly behavior , unwritten codes of conduct , a rugged work ethic , self-sufficiency , and self-governance originate . It is a sanctimonious and wholly organic institution . Men and women , though it is not some unwavering biological imperative in all cases , are genetically and biologically different - mothers typically being more nurturing , empathetic , and emotionally in-tune , and fathers typically being more stringent - stressing achievement , discipline , and hard work above all else . Fathers are generally more geared toward what 's rational and this-worldly , mothers toward what 's spiritual and transcendent . Most people who favor traditional marriage do not do so out of a deep-seated animus for those who deviate from the natural order : the Westboro Baptist Church and its devotees are but microbacteria in a petri dish . They do n't even claim the conservative mantle , in any case . They are not our titular spokesman , nor do they represent us . Religious and conservative leaders of yore have , for the most part , affirmed for themselves that marriage is between a man and a woman : Ronald Reagan , Pope John Paul II , G. K. Chesterton , and C. S. Lewis . We need n't wilt or capitulate before the mob : Biblical truths and inviolable institutions are forever - much more important than elections , ambitions of power , prestige , or social acceptance .

FTA : Paul is not just out to lunch when it comes to appropriating other people ’ s writing or hiring cranks . Consider : - He went to Heritage Foundation to convince conservatives he was serious about foreign policy , but he defended containment of a nuclear-armed Iran . Not even Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) believes that is rational . - He went to Howard University to convince African Americans he was a different kind of Republican , but wound up lecturing them about how good Republicans had been to African Americans in the past and presenting a “ you ’ re on you own ” economic vision that has zero appeal to these voters . - He went to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to argue against help for the non-jihadi Syrian rebels , but wound up arguing Bashar al-Assad is good for Christians

Christianity has changed drastically from the days of Acts and to insist otherwise is to be willfully ignorant . People change , and cultures change , and despite that the Bible has stood as a testament to the time Christ walked the Earth . In His interactions with man God gave a multitude of examples for ways to live , a hundred different and seemingly contrary ways to be a believer . The Bible is flexible , and it understands human nature , while still testifying to the Truth . The fact that you do not is more telling of you than of scripture or of homosexuals .

yeah this article was pretty horrible . The republican party is extremely splintered and it 's not all libertarians or theocrats . Its simply partisan bullshit where REPUBS R BAD DEMS GOOD when in reality theres good and bad things about both parties .
Not exactly . Even in gerrymandered districts , there is a lot of disaffection with the TPers . Even if this means more moderate GOPers are elected , it will make political change a tad easier ( but not nearly as amusing ) .

They do that because it works . Sure , people call them out on their bullshit , but it 's mostly the people who already disagree with them . Their `` base '' does n't listen to anyone who will call them out , and would refuse to believe it anyway even if you somehow forced them to hear it . They have been rewarded for abusing the system over and over again , to the point that we are on the verge of that becoming the system . That 's a big part of why it 's so important that they do n't get away with it this time ; this needs to hurt the GOP really , really badly . So badly that they actually think twice about doing it again . If we 're really lucky , that will be what finally splits the GOP into the several parties that it really is , but I 'm not holding my breath .

How anyone can even think to come up with excuses for those things is completely beyond me .

& gt ; Should Reading the Bible Make One an Atheist ? From the quoted Jillette test : 1:26-1:51 And I read the Bible cover to cover . And I think that anyone who is thinking about maybe being an atheist , if you read the Bible or the Koran or the Torah , cover to cover , I believe will emerge from that as an atheist . Jillette is referring to a mindset ( i. e. , people that already have doubts , considering leaving the Religious Faith ) whilst the article author writes from the position of someone defending the Religious Faith/not doubting . These different approaches , or points of view , will very likely result in different conclusions . If one is reading the Bible from the POV of doubt , the narratives will provide ample evidence to grow that doubt into non-belief or lack of belief . If the reader has the POV that God is real , that the narrative supports this position and that God is supreme , then that person will take the same narrative and see a positive towards God . Confirmation bias is action . I found the article to be a bit of a strawman . However , for those that wish to understand the Bible better , this short phrase is good advice : & gt ; `` Go to the source material '' Examine the scriptural material , and it 's source , of the narratives that predated the Torah/NT concerning `` God '' ( Yahweh ) , and the worship of God . From whence did Yahweh , and Yahweh worship originate ? How did this worship change before the Torah authors put oral tales to script ? How did the image of Yahweh , and Yahweh worship , evolve between the periods of the authorship of the sources of the Torah ? of the NT ?

The 2012 Employee Incentive Plan ( EIP ) awards range from 14 . 75 and 16 days of additional pay , among the best-ever awarded by the plan . They are based on 2012 financial results as recorded by Boeing Commercial Airplanes , Boeing Defense , Space and Security and the company as a whole . The awards , which will be paid beginning Feb. 28 , equate to a bonus of between 5 . 67 % and 6 . 15 % of an employee ’ s 2012 eligible earnings . In a press statement today Boeing says in Washington state , 51,820 employees will receive more than $ 295 . 9 million ( or roughly $ 5,000 per person ) . Not a bad bonus , but I wonder how much that tax break subsidizes .

The article makes no mention of : 1 ) Why his current insurance company dropped him . ( He was no longer profitable and they saw an opportunity to drop him and blame it on the ACA ? ) 2 ) What his new premiums will be . ( They would have mentioned them if they were going to be higher do n't you think ? ) 3 ) What his out of pocket expenses would be if he used a doctor that is in-network to that new policy . ( They would mention that too if it were going to be higher , do n't you think ? )
I 'm an atheist and a vet . I do volunteer work with vets , a lot of whom have been homeless . One vet told me about how he entered a program at a rescue mission in order to get off the booze and drugs and get back on his feet . This particular program offered housing and meals and a little therapy for work every day . When the director of the program ( an ordained minister ) learned that this vet was an atheist he had the guy 's bed stripped and his stuff boxed up . Then he let the vet work the rest of the day , and only told him he was back on the street at the end of the day . The guy had been in their program , working hard , for 6 months .
The argument has some serious anachronisms that prevent it from being as effective as it could be . To begin with , the word protest from the word protestari from Latin which meant `` avowal , pledge , solemn declaration. `` The first as `` statement of disapproval '' is attested in 1751 and is very clearly related to the side-effects of some of the more radical offshoots of the Protestant Reformation . However , the contemporary sense at the time was very clearly that it was `` a solemn declaration of reformation of the Church around the Gospel 's message , '' not as a call to be `` always criticizing everything that is n't us '' like this article seems to imply . That anachronism is borne out when we examine what the 15th Century Reformers actually did . The majority of the Protestant Reformers specifically set out a vision of an `` Evangelical Catholic Church '' that corrected the errors they were protesting . Furthermore , they generally retained the Creeds and Church Fathers and taught there is `` One Holy , Catholic and Apostolic Church. `` The clear intention was only to repair the unity of the Church around the Gospel 's promise which felt had been disrupted by the abuses in the Medieval Church . Therefore , this is why most Protestants are not `` protestants '' like this article describes , as the article itself noted . The notion of `` reformational catholicism '' is already inherent in most non-radical Protestant philosophies . There were , of course , many radicals who sought to continue the reforms in ways that were against the original intent of the Reformers . These radicals were clearly criticized by these same Reformers , however .
Corporate interests are starting to make a stand against the run away Tea Party movement which they helped build . This is always the problem when you build an astroturf movement . The movement can start to take itself seriously .

In many places it was just a bad idea though . For example , the proposed Omaha-Des Moines-Chicago line . It would barely travel faster than cars , cost more to ride , and cost taxpayers hefty amounts to keep running in the future . Yes , the federal government was willing to chip in large amounts . But that doesnt mean Iowa wants to pay the upkeep costs forever after that . We have too much existing infrastructure that needs repairing before we add another new mode . In a lot of areas it just doesnt make sense . Trains can be great for high density areas , such as having light rail options in cities and regional rail in our more dense areas . But trying to link them in less dense areas , like the midwest , makes little sense , especially when there are existing options ( such as things like Megabus ) that operate cheaper ( for the consumer and government ) , faster , and without the massive infrastructure investment to push a 3rd mode of travel ( in addition to vehicle and air ) . Plus options like megabus , not being fixed in place , can much easier adapt to changing demands in the future .
I believe a universal minimum income in the US used to be a republican proposal to get rid of cash welfare and food stamps and all the rest . I may be wrong about that but I believe in the 60s , when they believed the federal government had a purpose and taking care of labor relations was essential to the survival of capitalism they proposed a minimum annual income level . These days though , no that capitalism has nothing to compete with they do n't worry about such trivial things , capitalism won that war and there is no American left they have to appease .

I 'm sorry but IMO the basis for this `` editorial '' , i. e. the letter is made up BS . The author `` receives a letter '' with no proof available like a police report or the author contacting the person to discuss the information further and on the same page is an ad for his book about the same topic . IMO this story was based on something similar that was true , but this author more than likely expanded upon the story and the result is to manipulate us into a knee jerk emotional reaction . Does he propose a solution ? No . Does he do anything to further productive rational discussion on this topic ? No . Just look at the other articles he 's written , never citing anything , or providing proof , or even saying he spoke with his sources . He 's a good `` writer '' of fiction . Please do n't think that because I 'm sceptical of this author , that I some how support violence against woman or something like that . Completely the opposite . But this person appears to be looking to profit on the subject by manipulating you into believing him and that I completely disprove of . Also if I 'm wrong and this was true , then that pastor needs to think harder about whether they put God first , or their rules first . If you love your rules first , your doing it wrong .

Nope , this is not the view of the majority of Christians ( either around the world now , or throughout history ) , but it is typical of what are called `` Dispensational Premillennialists , '' and they happen to have a pretty strong ( but weakening ) presence in the churches of America , particularly in the south .
Here in NC , they recently got `` The invisible man '' banned from high schools for a year , too , using extremely similar arguments and language . This is n't the invisible man about the guy who becomes invisible due to radiation . The banned book was about a poor , black man in the south who felt like he was socially invisible , trudging through life with those around him using him as labor without ever learning his name . Here 's my thought : this is the third story I have heard in as many days about banning books , and in all three cases , the books were about poverty and disenfranchisement , about the disconnect between middle class america and poor america , about our class problems . In all three cases , they claim the books are offensive and pornographic , but in all three cases they seem to be very un-shocking books . I wonder if there is an organization trying to whip up right wing parents to ban books about race and class , so we bring up a generation of kids who never address these ideas , so that right wing economic policy gets through to them more easily . Just a thought
One thing that 's just kind of flying under the radar is that the GOP 's vision for reduced spending is already enshrined in the Democrats ( Senate ) funding proposals -- the sequester is the new established baseline . And yet it 's not considered a `` compromise '' from the right , however , the lapse of the Bush tax cuts is seen as a huge compromise on their part , and that one `` counts '' as the basis for new concessions from the Dems . No matter that the Dems are giving them essentially the Paul Ryan budget , it 's not enough .

As a Libertarian , I do n't like the free pass that this post implicitly gives to Reagan and GWB . When measuring the percent increase in the national debt , the Reagan and GWB administrations ' stewardship of the debt was unconscionable . The debt was $ 1 . 142 trillion on the date of Reagan 's first budget ( beginning of Fiscal Year 1982 ) , and it was $ 2 . 857 trillion at the end of his last budget , for a percent increase of 150 % . For GWB , $ 6 . 228 at the start and $ 13 . 562 at the end , for a percent increase of 118 % . As for Obama , $ 13 . 562 at the start and $ 17 . 204 currently , for a percent increase of 27 % ( but he is only responsible for 4 fiscal years so far ) . Dick Cheney told Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill , . Bottom line , pointing fingers about the debt is a losing argument for Republicans . The best thing to do would be to stop talking about it , sweep it under the rug , and make sure it never happens again . I mean , can you imagine if Obama was on track to increase the debt to $ 33 . 905 trillion ? ! That 's what it would take to be the equivalent of what happened under Reagan . I disapprove of just about everything Obama and the Democrats are doing these days , but accuracy is important . Blaming Obama is a losing argument when it comes to the debt .

It is new to a lot of people . Most people do n't understand everything is being stored and AFAIK the NSA is still denying it .

I hope he 's more set to go nuclear then the last time he said he was set to go nuclear .

Remind me again why this big-money political action committee enjoys tax-exempt status ? Benefits of devoting yourself to telling others how they should live their lives ?
Pre-Giuliani years here we come
From someone who really does n't know much about this : Is this launch mostly noteworthy because they 'll attempt to recover one of the stages of the vehicle intact ? ( that nice system that there was a video of recorded from a chopper ? )
All you need to do these days is get your income defined as a return on an investment .
This asshole is going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of Americans .

Look , I appreciate that we all love porn , and that this has everyone very scared , but this is not the abuse we 're all waiting for . This one actually claims in the memo to be about targeting jihadists and debasing them within their own groups . That 's why their porn habits would matter . The abuse we 're looking for is a policy targeting specific American individuals on American soil who are n't participating in violent acts , without going through proper legal channels .
`` No evidence '' did n't make his list , except maybe indirectly in how the bible really seems like a book of fantasy stories . It 's an odd way of thinking , to me . It 's like wishful thinking turned backwards where you do n't believe in God because you do n't like religion .
you got it the wrong way around . Every single poll has stated that people think GOP is the problem . Guess we will find out for sure when Hillary is elected amiright ?
For the republicans , probably a crazy fuck that has zero chance of being elected in a nation race , but will pull in tons of cash when he runs .
Both sides only posted a partial deal . Here is the full , official deal : lobelog . com/official-4-page-iran-nuclear-deal-joint-plan-of-action/
Itchy ears comes to mind . The best false hoods are 95 % truth and 5 % lie
That 's because there is a law preventing changes to Congress 's pay unless it is voted on and even then it can only be implemented after the next Congress comes in . I think most would agree this is a good thing . This is a nonstory designed solely to capitalize on populist outrage .
Almost a decade old is more than a bit ... Also : `` their ''

Repeal and attempts to alter the existing law are perfectly acceptable and examples of the process at work . What the republicans have done and are continuing to do is not acceptable -- it is extralegal , it is an attempt to game the system rather than to legislate . It would be wonderful if the GOP turned their energy toward correcting actual flaws in the plan , perhaps even presenting a better one rather than insisting on this pointless exercise that does nothing but leave us all exhausted and frustrated .
Yes , I 've been hearing this bullshit on the radio and TV all week and it 's infuriating . The reason those do n't carry over is because they are scams that do n't cover shit if you actually get injured . But no one seems to be talking about that fact .
You do realize that most of the current job lose is actually because of technology right ? Automation has killed more jobs than any other factor out there . It is the giant elephant in the room that no one wants to address because everyone loves technology but it is simple fact . technologyreview . com/featuredstory/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/
It 's a start . The fact that it drives the Reich Wingers nuts is just gravy .
And possibly feels guilty that he resides in and makes his living from the high-income class ?
Unfortunately , they ca n't . At least for the 30-40 odd gerrymandered Deep South House seats the GOP created that ensure that , even with a national Democratic sweep , they 'll remain Republican districts . To say nothing of the further steps these states have taken to restrict valid voters from exercising their franchise . Anti-democratic ? You betcha ! Besides , the Republican Party makes too much money off these extremists to remove them from their group . About the only saving grace to this is that the GOP `` moderates '' ( they only want to strangle public education , Social Security & amp ; Medicare in its crib , versus blow its face off with a shotgun ) have lost control and must now kowtow to these lunatics .
So true Alan . I will not give money to DNCC and the rest of the blanket orgs again . Thank you
UPMC , supposedly a non-profit hospital system , has done the same thing for a while now .
I think it 's a good start , and it 'll be interesting to see how well it works . I 'm fairly progressive , however I do think that the states should be left to do this , not the federal government . Maybe it 's the moderate conservative in me , or this recent harrumph about Obamacare , but I just think that if the federal government were to initiate something like this , it would be way too messy . But with that said , I ca n't wait to see how this pans out !
This is really no surprise . All it takes is an awareness deliberate public manipulation is prevalent , and concerted . Another recent article about wikipedia : independent . co. uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/wikipedia-we-have-blocked-250-sock-puppets-for-biased-editing-of-our-pages-8895112 . html
I 'm slowly-but-surely learning to hate my generation . I do n't wan na . I really do n't . But shit-asses like this keep emerging and I ca n't help but feel like we got it wrong . Ron Paul Revolution propaganda successfully converted a sizable portion of Millennials into free market cappie shit-asses . And I 'm afraid that that conversion is permanent for a lot of them . It essentially invented a right-wing contingent in the Millennial generation .
My family would shut this crap down immediately . We get together for a fabulous meal , not this sad-childhood baloney .
sigh fuckin ' assholes over there think men should have all the priviledges and women should stay subserviant without a voice . shame on them
Multicam , hands down . Also , let Crye Precision make them since they produce the best quality by a wide margin . Their op cammies are indestructible .
Do we own our bodies or do we not ? I hate to say that there 's a point to be made . Yes , it gives open door to exploitation of the poor , but is it the role of the government or other people to dictate what we can and ca n't do with our bodies ? Please discuss and mention why this should be different than when a woman owns her body for an abortion . I 'm not taking a side . I really want to see the discussion .
Mike Rowe sounds like a great role model . I loved his show . Conservatives and liberals should listen to his message .
The `` American Family Association '' ... you got ta love it - they represent the American family like Charles Manson and his `` family '' did ...
You 've done a really great job keeping track of these . As someone else mentioned , though , most of them here are from Media Matters . Have you seen these incidents reported elsewhere ? What was the reception/interpretation ? I 'm interested in how slightly less left leaning groups as well as far right leaning groups would interpret this information . ( I have n't looked through your 300 examples yet , the page is still loading since before I started this comment . )
That link is worthy of a post in itself .
I 've read Boswell 's books , both of them . Christianity , Social Tolerance , and Homosexuality is a bit better , but Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe is an exercise in wishful thinking . I 'm sympathetic , I have many of the same wishes , but it is . What 's interesting is that if you read more than the dust jacket he basically admits as much , arguing that while these relationships were meant to be celibate they probably did n't all live up to the ideal and that this created a social niche for homosexual men while not being exclusive to them . I 'm not sure I like his reading , but even his own position , at least as I could discern it at the time ( this was ages ago ) , has a bit more subtlety than `` omg ancient gay marriages. ``
1 Timothy 2 & gt ; 1First of all , then , I urge that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all people , 2for kings and all who are in high positions , that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life , godly and dignified in every way . 3This is good , and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior , 4who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth . 5For there is one God , and there is one mediator between God and men , the mana Christ Jesus , 6who gave himself as a ransom for all , which is the testimony given at the proper time . 7For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle ( I am telling the truth , I am not lying ) , a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth . While I will probably read Piper 's book I think it is odd to write on something so clearly stated already in Holy Scripture . Does God desire all me to be saved ? Yes , absolutely he does .
Baptists , evangelicals , church of christ/god , etc all could n't give two shits what the pope does . He does n't represent them or their views of church doctrine . Catholics really only make up 25 % of our country so it does n't surprise me that the GOP is n't tied to what the pope says .
& gt ; Many of them could use the free day to take their parents to doctor ’ s appointments Except the doctor would n't be working if the norm was a 4-day workweek . I 'm all for working less , but some of the examples given here are not correct . A true 4-day workweek would mean a one day longer weekend .
Sadly , they already have . The public schools and colleges are simply indoctrination centers for the liberal agenda controlled by socialist teachers unions . When I was in first grade , my parents bought me nice , Crayola-brand markers for class . The first day of school , the teacher took them from me and gave me back cheap RoseArt/Store Brand markers , with one or two of my original Crayola markers . That was the first lesson in socialism . Some students had better supplies than others , and that was unfair . This practice is done in most public schools , ask any parent .
As usual there 's some idiot making this argument : & gt ; `` I do n't believe the government should have to tell me I have to buy any insurance , '' said Joshua Lucas of Arizona , a stay-at-home father of two . `` I 'm 34 years old , and I am in great health , so I do n't feel like I have to have it. `` That 's great that you do n't feel like you have to have it , but if you end up in the ER and have no insurance then other people end up paying those bills . It 's not a choice you get to make because it impacts other people directly . If you have at least an extra $ 250,000 lying around to cover an emergency then I 'd say you have some room to make that argument , but something tells me Joshua the stay-at-home father of two does not have that kind of money saved up for emergencies .
Good on the EFF for calling out the NY Times for being the frequent scumbags and corporate lackeys that they are . That paper has gone so far downhill in the last 20 years or so its pathetic .
Thanks mirandapd for introducing me to Katie Goodman . Never saw the videos before and they rock .
If you give a mouse a cookie ...
Yeah , people need to stop shooting elephants in the face for fun . I think there is enough evidence to suggest they are sentient .
but even the cheapest plans offer preventative services for free . And being 5-10k in medical debt is a much better position than being 100k-1million+ debt ( which can be complicated to file for bankruptcy : nolo . com/legal-encyclopedia/medical-debt-chapter-7-bankruptcy . html )
I really do n't think this qualifies as being dicks . This is intelligently making a point . This turns the tables of the actions and beliefs of the common democratic liberal on a much smaller , understandable scale , such in a way that is familiar , realistic , and easy for anyone to relate to . Even if they do n't like that its the truth .
Any idea what became of the horrified liberal ?
Wisconsin here . Yup , our esteemed Governor is quite proud about kicking 92,000 constituents off of Medicaid . The base , some of which are directly effected , continue to cheer . After all , they must find some other positive aspect of the agenda Walker was given , since the jobs plan has been shown to significantly stifle job growth .
This hurt my mental spellchecker . On a serious note , where are schools open for Veterans ' day ?
This is a very dangerous situation . In all the countries where fascism took over , it did so at a time of left-wing ascendancy . The Tea Partiers will only continue to participate in elections if they can win them . Once they start losing , if they follow the fascist pattern , they will begin seriously calling for violence . Then we have our Kristallnacht , and who knows where it goes from there . I seriously hope I 'm out to lunch on this one .
Yes , many of us are aware of the liberal media 's double standard and pc politics . Those that are n't aware will forever remain stupid and by default , Liberal . oh and please do n't correct my post of the improper use of capitalization because
What 's wrong with supporting the troops ? They 're people , just like everyone else .
& gt ; Today , they followed up by unbanning The Huffington Post , which had recently reasserted its relevance by publishing an op-ed by President Obama . Wait , that 's a joke , right ?
& gt ; Yes . My 2014 premiums rolled out . I will pay $ 72 per check ( bi-weekly ) for full coverage and NO deductible . You lucky dog . My health premiums dropped dramatically also , but I am paying way more than you . Looking at my states health exchange premium rates , I will save a ton once Obamacare kicks in on October 1st .
Three of his four kids are gay . What are the odds of that happening ? My very rough calculation is that it is something like 1 in 2,000 , but I could be totally wrong . What 's also interesting is that among the four siblings heterosexuality is the minority orientation .
The better question is if we allowed to have personal secrets . If we can legally have personal secrets , we should then reasonably be able to utilize encryption to protect them . The problem is that this is n't how the government feels in the interest of national security .
& gt ; Republicans have argued that in pushing nominations , Obama is “ packing ” the court , and have insisted that Obama is trying to tilt the court ’ s ideological balance in a Democratic direction . I bet a million dollars that if it was a Republican president pushing conservative minded justices , there would be no opposition whatsoever . Ideological balance ? Fuck them .
This is n't the Air Force oath , it is the cadet honor oath that they take at the end of basic training `` I will not lie , steal or cheat , nor tolerate among us anyone who does , furthermore I resolve to do my duty and live honorably , ( so help me god ) . ``
He 's a cloned turd all around , that 's for sure .
As a fellow Pennsylvanian I really do feel like the saying `` Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with Alabama in between '' has some truth .
To be fair , in general , voting is n't ( or should n't be ) just about choosing what is best for yourself .
Take a moment to watch the above video . Do n't post mean comments , this fellow is genuinely scared of his government and he 's trying to express it . This is what we 're up against though . Conservatives have been taught to fear their government , taught that their government is some other , external entity that is out to take away their rights , their money and their freedoms . If we 're to make inroads for the Progressive movement we 're going to need to address and assuage these fears . We 're also going to have to dispel some of the misinformation and misunderstandings people like this have been exposed to . This video illustrates the fundamental misunderstandings of how our government operates and who our government consists of .
Haters gon na hate . He hates everyone .

Maybe it 's just me , but I 'm not really sure why Wall Street is the headline `` villain '' in this story ? Private money managers have always been involved in the investment of public money because it is extremely inefficient to require every municipality to have a team of portfolio managers running the entire fund . The real issue seems to be the systematic underfunding and raiding of pension money by the Government to fund various projects/tax cuts etc .
It was shared because of the mentality women are subjected to , by pastors , by fellow church members , by family and coworkers ... a mentality that lacks compassion and heaps blame and guilt on a victim of violence . This story is am extreme example , yet it gets to the crux of the epidemic ... yes an epidemic that is causing trauma , m Injury and even death to millions of women all over the world . Even us `` civilized '' nations are not immune , with violence against women at only slightly lower rates than developed nations ... according to WHO . The church can do better , from the most conservative to the most liberal to work to end this
iFunny ? Really ?
About 1 in 6
A good idea , but would probably need a constitutional ammendment . Write to your state government to build support for the idea .
Kinda like what the Democrats did for years and years before Republicans gained a foothold .
It 's unbelievable this is how government is supposed to work . We compromise to pass laws and make things happen , the same goes for any negotiation in government . This guy is a mini King George .
& gt ; Membership in this elite group is likely to come from being involved in some aspect of the financial services or banking industry , real estate development involved with those industries , or government contracting . Some hard working and clever physicians and attorneys can acquire as much as $ 15M- $ 20M before retirement but they are rare . & gt ; Folks in the top 0 . 1 % come from many backgrounds but it 's infrequent to meet one whose wealth was n't acquired through direct or indirect participation in the financial and banking industries . & gt ; Most of the serious economic damage the U. S. is struggling with today was done by the top 0 . 1 % and they benefited greatly from it . & gt ; A highly complex set of laws and exemptions from laws and taxes has been put in place by those in the uppermost reaches of the U. S. financial system . It allows them to protect and increase their wealth and significantly affect the U. S. political and legislative processes . They have real power and real wealth . Ordinary citizens in the bottom 99 . 9 % are largely not aware of these systems , do not understand how they work , are unlikely to participate in them , and have little likelihood of entering the top 0 . 5 % , much less the top 0 . 1 % . Moreover , those at the very top have no incentive whatsoever for revealing or changing the rules . So , basically investment bankers , etc have taken over and are now running - and ruining - our country . They are an existential threat - left alone , their actions will kill us . What do we do about them ? They have so completely twisted the laws so there seems to be no legal recourse for their actions , which suggests the only ways to protect ourselves are extra-legal ... Hopefully , I am wrong , and there are still legal ways to counter them , because otherwise the future will be disastrous , no matter who wins .
I agree . The interpretation of `` turn the other cheek '' seems especially contrived into a political statement .
it 's really not about money . The lack of a decent health system in the US is a human rights issue , and should be treated like one
It was a great night except for Washington state . and the success of in Seattle makes me kinda sad .
His naiveté makes me cringe on the inside .
I think this is just one more way that the media tries to belittle atheists . Who tries to pretend the person they 're angry at does n't exist ? Children .
What 's the reason for such an eccentric orbit ?
Oh my
A valid question . Until about a decade ago , I would have scoffed and recommended heavy duty tinfoil . Now ... now these people have insulated themselves so effectively from the real world that even the threat of bursting that bubble sends them into a panic . I think that if their bubble media plays the same game in 2016 as they did this last time , and the loony tunes brigade does n't see their defeat coming , or worse yet , thinks for sure they 've won ... again ... they will snap . What that actually means is anyone guess . Could be a revolt , kind of . Lots of the wing-nuts are very well armed , having been preparing for that martial law they think Obama will declare any day now . Of course they would fighting the military that they have voted to hurl money at for years , which is sort of like banking on your own defeat before you begin . Try explaining that to one of those idiots and watch them turn purple trying to figure out why they did that !
Their business depends partly on their likability . If they become unnecessarily greedy with google+ it could harm them more than they could imagine .
Nah , just toss it in the recycle bin .
Yes , please ... Identify yourselves .
Thank you ; it was n't working for me .
They are n't crazy , they 're stupid .
I do n't think it 's necessarily dying in America , but I would say more individuals are bending the beliefs of religions to not be so ridiculous . There are exceptions , of course , but more people are starting to believe in just a creator . Not all that other stuff .
It 's not . It 'd be like calling a debate 'civil ' if you were in a car with someone and they were speeding towards a cliff with the intent of going over the cliff if you did n't accept all of their demands and give up yours .
Because your bullet does n't need to agree with a bunch of other people 's bullets before it kills anyone ?
& gt ; was Still is , really .
Is that what we 've come too as a nation ? Our most vulnerable do n't deserve any assistance , they should just sell body parts if they need money ? We cut all this money from assistance programs because we are supposedly bankrupt , and yet , each taxpayer in this nation pays approximately $ 4000/year in taxes to cover corporate subsidies , and no one bats an eye ? Stossel , I hope you get run over by a bus , you dickholster .
Soooo ... yeah . Conservatives .... racist homophobes . : O
So beware , when the cult ends , it 's not usually by everyone realizing how silly they were and retreating to sanity .
I 'm kind of skeptical . The question is about school kids specifically . A lot of schools have a Confederacy-related mascot , so many might interpret the question to be about official school clothing .
I literally just purchased 4 ps3 games for 10 $ a pop . Waiting is definitely worth it .
I think everyone should go for it . The GOP has already said Obama planned it to fail , so the system would go to single payer . I have an idea : Let 's go to single payer before it fails .
The administration will claim victory and say the website is working fine for everyone on the 1st . It will be up to the media ( haha ) , social media , etc . to hold them accountable .
Yet at the same time , through God ALL things are possible . I take that as I 'm able to handle anything that comes my way through my faith in God and the fact that He is literally 'with me ' .
Liberals and Conservatives should be fighting like hell to reduce the costs of healthcare . Not merely figuring out ways to make other people pay for it .
I feel that , so long as all participants are there of their own free will , there 's nothing wrong with porn . If we could move our society past its ridiculous sexual hang-ups , porn would cease to be useful as an avenue of blackmail .
I do n't think it was mocking Obamacare , it was mocking everyone else . Have you ever noticed that when SNL did skits with George Bush , Bush was the joke , but when they do skits with Obama , everyone else is the joke and Obama is level-headed ?
& gt ; This is because about 10 % of Catholic doctrine is derived more from Apostolic Tradition than Sacred Scripture . I 've seen this statistic thrown around the sub a few times , and I do n't quite understand it . Is n't 100 % of Catholic doctrine from Holy Tradition ? I mean , Holy Tradition is what led to the canonization of the Bible , so that `` 90 % Biblical '' is just a subgroup of `` 100 % Tradition '' ....
Wow ..... just ... wow
Good points , but the previous GOP talking points did n't keep kids from seeing pandas at the zoo or shutdown government websites . This stuff has a high level of visibility . No idea if conservatives will care , most of them seem to be low information voters or hot button voters , but moderates and swing voters are n't walking away with a rosy picture of the GOP right now and the last election showed us , regardless of the GOP 's 'unskewing of polls ' , these voters went for Obama , not Romney . I guess we 'll see during the midterms how this shit went down with voters .
Per the article , a lot of it was just `` good luck '' . But I 'm sure reddit is n't going to just believe that ...
They did a good job I think . Hopefully one day there 'll be a Dutch revival and it 'll be reclaimed as a place if worship . Until then there 's worse things it can be used as I suppose .
Kinda ironic considering Obama 's support of unions .
LOL silly USA . There are lunatics on the streetcorners but you should n't make them Majority Leader in your government .
& gt ; Obama thought he could change things , but when the curtain was pulled back , he either saw something that scared him into backing off , or was pushed into becoming a hypocrite . Or he just said whatever it took to get elected .
Typical liberal
& gt ; No interviews , for any reason , ever Unless it 's on Fox News .
I do n't want this to be downvoted to oblivion . I 'm being genuine here and trying to start a discussion . Why is a deficit/debt a bad thing ?
They do n't care about the troops while they serve either . How many Marines died from shower electricution in Iraq again ?
Male sovereign power ?
Now to see whether he will deliver on his promise or not .
I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone . Just because they have deep pockets , does n't mean they know what they are doing . The idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous . They ca n't maintain those properties properly . Each house has its own set of unique issues , because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves . The people who cooked up this plan , should have taken those billions of dollars and just bought large apartment complexes . Oversight would be easier , the buildings are built to withstand the wear and tear being rentals and maintenance can be dealt with more efficiently . For all we know the reason they did n't go that route is because they knew they could write their own rules with individual properties . Remember the part in Upton Sinclair 's book `` The Jungle '' where the family rents to own a property , that is in fact just badly built with a `` cess pool '' underneath . This is what is happening again . All they are creating are slums in neighborhoods , destroying the true market value of properties , and denying regular folk the opportunity to own a home .
I wish religious fundamentalism would be officially regarded as a mental illness .
Leaving all the other nonsense aside : what 's up with the representantive from florida saying god placed adam into the garden of eden to `` work it '' and that `` work is not a penalty ; work is a blessing '' ? My bible foo is n't exactly waterproof but I 'm pretty sure that adam 's penalty was banishment from the garden where the fields had to be worked in order for shit to grow . The serpent has to crawl on its belly , Eve gets painful child birth and Adam gets work .
Nah , am worse in real-ity .
It should have absolutely none .
Poor child .
`` If I like your plan , you can keep your plan . Period. ``
Like one of those edugames ? Sounds good really .
It would be nice to be able to explain more about some of the answers . For example , I 'm a Baptist , but Baptists in Norway are theologically more closely aligned to Anapbaptists than Southern Baptists in America . ( I feel like Southern Baptists often give us a bad name . They seem to completely disregard liberty of conscience among other things that we stand for . )
What makes you think Warren is n't Obama V 2 . 0 ? That 's my main question . I was with you in 2008 , thinking Obama was a more progressive option . We were both quite wrong it seems ; I do n't think I trust Warren to not be more of the same .
Unless it 's Bush 's election , but that was n't really an election since the Supreme Court basically awarded him the office .
Virginia wants the ( D )
& gt ; But the EC - was not even close 332/206 - or 61/38 . & gt ; And even the two elections the GOP did win in the last 30 years , were both by a single state . ( Florida '00 - Ohio '04 ) Why is why they started a 3 prong attack on the elections : Suppress the vote - Voter ID laws , inaccurate voter rolls falsely disqualifying legitimate voters Gerrymandering districts Push to divide electoral college votes by winner in each congressional district in Blue and Purple states , but keeping it winner takes all in Red states . The conservatives are n't even pretending anymore that this is nothing more than a bold face attempt to steal elections .
My father worked in Saudi Arabia and became unwell . My stepmother had to dress up as a man - which my mother said was n't difficult - and drive him to the hospital
Simple , `` free market '' is code for `` let us do what we want , when we want , with no oversight or government interference ... unless we fuck everything up , then the government can bail us out ''
The analysis of the numbers is actually wrong here . The 19 . 741 % of prisoners who gave no answer could well be all atheists . You can make no assumptions about these . Is it possible , perhaps , that they mostly gave no answer because they are atheists ?
I think the right feels worse about Hillary . I would think there would actually be less issue with warren .
That watermark is your downfall .
As far away as possible .
what the hell is wrong with ending white privilege ? or employment rights for trans people ? And by `` disallow critical assessment '' of evolution I bet they really mean `` do n't want creationism taught as scientific theory. ``
Silent Circle is closed source and should n't be trusted .
As a non-american this is getting annoying . If half the population of your country is this stupid then why have n't the other half tricked them into just going along with them ? The only thing left to think about americans is that the whole bloody lot are dumb as shit . I know you are n't really all stupid , I have many good intellgent friends who are americans , but you guys do need to realize how the entire world is looking at you like a bunch of monkeys with dynamite and matches right now .
No , not even close . Capitalism died along time ago when we let large companies write legislation that small companies ca n't afford or comply with . This is why no new banks have opened up in 30+ years .
You know , if my daughter were in a similar situation , and I found out a pastor had said something like that to her , I ca n't honestly say how I 'd handle it . This makes me pretty angry just to read about it .
That was a rather stupid article . It criticizes atheism for not being about more than atheism . That makes no sense . `` Atheists tend to ... `` `` Many atheists believe that ... `` Atheism is not a general world philosophy or political movement . It 's a lack of belief in God .
I 'm still getting a blank page with a title header that says `` success URL '' . Got it earlier today , and just now . I got in once a few days ago , and Experian said my address was n't my address and could n't confirm my identity . I was at work and did n't have time to call , so I closed out . Have n't been able to get back in since .
Transhumanism is a morally questionable set of ideas , at best , but this article is put forward by a few crazies from backwoods USA .
The government is not a charity .
if he has a gun against an innocent persons head , he deserved to be shot . yes he might be troubled , he might have a rough past , he might have just fallen in with the wrong crowd . But in the end he is the one who decided to pull the gun on somebody , it is his responsibility he has NOBODY else to blame but his own self . I believe in forgiveness and second chances and I hope this young man turns his life around , but he has nobody but himself to blame for where he is .
Garfunkel and Oates are amazing . `` Sex with Ducks '' is another fantastic takedown of religious stupidity .
Part of me thinks Obamacare was designed to fail leaving single payer as the option to `` save the day '' . The people that engineered it just ca n't be that stupid ..... can they ? It has to be a conspiracy .
Something like a CVD type 3D printer ?
Because they 're following the lead , either directly or indirectly , of Fox News and the Religious Right . They 're told that health insurance is evil , and they 're not in the habit of questioning what they 're told by those they consider to be reliable sources . Though honestly , this is sort of a chicken-and-egg situation .
well at least this proves he 's a little more pragmatic than his father ... not that that 's saying much .
It 's already on the books in New York , but the Democratic & amp ; Republican politicians think it 'd be better to give the billions of dollars back every year rather than fully funding our needed social programs .
The government has no rights . The government , at least as the constitution spells out , only has powers granted by the electorate . It has no `` right '' to any of those powers .
Wow .. they are so polite and suspiciously similar : I agree . Sen Warren has a nice ring to it and she will get a hell of a lot more done in Congress than the White House . You make a good and intelligent case …one I 've had in the back of my mind . Her value as a Senator is irreplaceable . And I agree because I like that as senator , she has the ability to focus all of her energy on particular key issues I read this article and am in agreement . I think the country would be better off with her as a senator . I have thought the same thing . I think she is in the right place at the right time . I agree , I did n't think I would agree with you but you made a great case . Keeping her in the legislature is invaluable .
I would n't say it 's terrorism , but it IS extortion . And it 's not democracy . Recall Congress !
Awesome letter .

I think similar results were reported a few months ago . But either way , this makes sense . The biggest and most well funded and supported opposition to evolution in schools comes not from young earth creationism , but from Intelligent Design .
Hate to be the wet blanket here . I like Rep. Holt and all , but this is going nowhere . The bill needs to be serious . He needs to have co-sponosrs . Most of all , it needs to address piecemeal , serious , actual changes and repeals that need to be made . Sorry , but this is the 'legislative equivalent ' of what Ted Cruz did yesterday . We need pragmatism . Set out realistic , practical things that can be done , and accomplish them . Enough with the futile gestures already . & amp ; nbsp ; EDIT : The good news is ,

Sweet ! Thanks for sharing !
The problem is actually much worse . Unemployment among young people is at a level that would have been considered a crisis on par with the depression in 1950 . Fixes are not as easy as raising the minimum though , we have a much broader work force ( almost all women work outside the home which was less the case in 1950 ) and much less demand for labor do to automation and computers . Its not just factory jobs either , we have tons of software solutions that render human labor far less necessary , heck even the humble voice mail is a job killer . So while raising the minimum wage and even indexing it is fair its not going to help very much and might even speed up automation since robotics are getting better by the day . There is an ethical solution , social credit ( pay everyone a base wage ) combined with a distributive economic system ( changing the system to incentivize distribution within the middle tier ) but they are politically difficult to get into play . Also both require big changes , a much smaller military , trade controls and deep limits to immigration which have other issues . And note the current solution of social democracy does n't work well . Europe has it and also has heavy youth unemployment and low birth rates . Its not as bad as actual Marxism ( 100 % fail by volume ) but it does n't seem to resolve the problem . Its slows the bleeding but it does n't heal the body . I think and I do not know that the above might work . If it does n't well as Aaron Cleary puts it `` Enjoy the decline ''

First comment to the article sums it up pretty well . Andrew Craig · Hendrix College I 'm coming over to your house to eat your food , sleep on your couch , and watch your TV , whether you like it or not . But do n't you dare try to stop me- that would be initiation of force ! What a bunch of patently ridiculous nonsense . If you want to make some psuedo-Marxist case against the existence of private property , fine , but do n't set yourself up as attacking libertarianism in doing so . You 're attacking the entirety of Western Civilization , and the laws and mores of the vast majority of the world . Trespassing is not a uniquely libertarian concept .

Let me get this straight : & gt ; COPE ’ s challenge [ PDF ] states that the teaching of evolution “ amounts to an excessive government entanglement with religion ” and violates the rights of Christian parents . Has anyone told them the Pope accepts evolution as a scientifically valid theory ? Has anyone told them it is n't just this pope , but John Paul II as well ? Are they suggesting that Catholics should ignore the Pope ? Are they suggesting that Catholics who follow the Pope are not good Christians ? Are they suggesting the current Pope and his predecessor are not good Christians ?

The percentage you raised debt in absolute terms is meaningless and misleading . It 's easy to see why this fails if you replace `` debt '' with `` income '' . Imagine Reagan 's gets a huge 118 % raise going from $ 11,420/yr to $ 28,570/yr , while Obama 's only gets a meager 27 % raise going from $ 135,620/yr to $ 172,040/yr . If Obama was as good as Reagan and got a 118 % raise he would be making $ 339,050/yr . Comparing spending or debt to GDP is more legitimate . As a percentage of GDP , Obama is spending more than Reagan . As a percentage of GDP , debt increased by about 20 % under 8 years of Reagan . Under Obama has already exceeded that . See graphs below : Also , notice before FDR and the new deal , federal spending was about 2 . 5 % GDP except during wars . Since WW2 is has averaged about 20 % . Also , Reagan was working with a Democrat controlled House , so the situation was basically reversed of what it is today with regard to spending . Finally , saying that because Republicans have increased debt they ca n't criticize Democrats for doing it is wrong and dangerous thinking . The parties change every year as values change and politicians get replaced .

Support for legalizing has risen significantly in the last three years , and the 2010 election was problematic because younger people who are more likely to vote for Marijuana legalization tend to only vote during the federal elections cycle .

Just finished listening , it was pretty interesting . I love Keller , although I have to say he did n't push hard enough on what sounded a bit like a kind of slippery sophistry coming from Epstein : Appealing to beauty in trying to define what beauty is , assuming there 's a place `` where we 're going , '' etc . it seemed like he did this the whole time .
Funny how the private sector and the wealthy are literally the goose that lays the golden egg .... the source of revenue for all the wonderful social programs that the Left deems so indispensable for a humane society ..... AND YET , the Left seems utterly impervious , if not downright hostile , to the health and well-being of said goose . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again : The most effective social program ever devised is a paying job in the private sector . It costs tax-payers nothing .... and it produces tax revenue for gov't . Private enterprise has lifted literally hundreds of millions of Chinese and Indians out of poverty just in the last 25 years . Think what it could do in America if it were n't drowning in tax and regulatory over-kill .

People have confirmation bias . I doubt too many people will rush to embrace the change of view with new information . However , if this law succeeds , in twenty years or fewer it will be like Social Security and Medicare-very difficult to touch without severe backlash and almost impossible to abolish .
With both sides assuming that the other is too ignorant to understand anything that is happening in the world there ’ s no potential for constructive discourse . People who complain about biased media are forgetting that this is one of its hallmarks , and allowing yourself to get caught up in this is what drives their ratings .

The science vs religion thing kills me . You believe in religion and accept scientific reasoning . They are not mutually exclusive and have varying degrees of belief and acceptance . I almost lost a friend a couple years ago after a day of drinking ending up in a discussion on god . She accused me of choosing to `` believe '' in science and said ( hopefully just arguing the other side ) that she thinks evolution is bullshit . We are still good friends but hopefully will never discuss god again .
How do you look reasonable when you refuse to vote on a bill the Senate submitted on Friday that would have averted shutdown ?
Yes I would agree their faith is just as earnest as ours , but like the article said , the theology of Mormonism is very different from main stream Christianity and is cleverly worded on the surface to look alike , but deep down in the specifics , Mormonism and most main line Christian Church theology is very different . So i would n't call it exclusivity , if the president of the LDS church said himself that he wants Christians outside of the LDS to come and change `` their Jesus '' . I do n't think that will help , but maybe it will . Love to keep talking about it with you .
The shutdown is n't keeping them from going bankrupt . That will happen around Oct 17th at current spending .
Awesome scene , but I think it would be much better if she skipped the `` I believe in science and evolution '' part and went straight into the `` I can not get behind a supreme being who ... `` Science is n't a '' belief '' and although some Christians do deny science it is not nearly as common as using religion to justify horrible things and condemn people for not being Christian .

The evangelical right made a pact with the Republican party , for better or for worse , and now it needs to fulfill that pact until the bitter end or loses its political voice permanently . American party coalitions are heterogeneous , but they endure as along as the different groups find more agreement with each other than with the opposition . After Republicans won back the Congress in 1994 , they developed a political strategy to hold their coalition together . Many people contributed to the strategy including Newt Gingrich , Karl Rove , Paul Coverdell , Paul Weyrich , and Ralph Reed , but the chief architect was probably Grover Norquist , a political operative who , along with Rove and Reed , came of age in the early Reagan years . The strategy was based on creating an alliance between business , which had sometimes divided its loyalties between Republicans and Democrats , and the array of social and economic interest groups that had begun backing Republicans . In weekly meeting held on Wednesdays at the office of his Americans for Tax Reform , Norquist put forth the idea that business groups , led by the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business ( NFIB ) , but also including the specialized trade associations , should back socially conservative Republican candidates , while right-to-life or gun rights organizations should back tax cuts and deregulation . What would bind the different parts together was a common opposition to raising taxes , which Norquist framed in a pledge he demanded that Republican candidates make . Business could provide the money , and the single-issue and evangelical groups the grassroots energy to win elections .

To be fair , these are two businesses at Microsoft which are hemorrhaging money .

As a conservative : Morality and economics do n't and should n't mix ...
I think the article is too vague and not specific enough . Social programs are and have been widely available . I do n't believe the lack of programs are to blame . I also do n't think poverty is to blame because children poor children from poverty areas do excel . It is the breakdown of social values and the family support unit . Children from homes that promote education can and do succeed . We have a cultural problem with education . We expect everyone to be high achievers and work white collar jobs making very high wages . I like what Mike Rowe promotes , that college is n't for everyone and that you can succeed without a college education . College is n't for everyone . People with less than a high school education can build a solid life . Please do n't misunderstand , social programs are important , but social programs have failed to universally improve the areas the article addresses . We need a new not a tired old strategy . Again , social programs are important and needed , but social programs will not solve the problems with education . One footnote , I think teachers unions get a bad reputation because they are set up to protect and advantage labor over the education of students , that fact can not be denied . Their first mission is to promote the welfare of the teacher . When they protect bad teacher 's , they get ( but do n't deserve ) the reputation they get . I cringe when I see a teachers union spokesperson talk about how high quality education is their number one goal , when everyone knows the number one goal is to enhance the welfare of the union members . People can spin the goals of teachers unions with talking points all day . They need to be genuine . Even the children know the unions are disingenuous at times .
I read that in Joey Mousepad 's voice , except saying `` intragnisent '' .
What 's great about this is Obama is really calling him to the mat . If a vote were called and did n't pass it would legitimize the GOP BS . If it passes Boehner is finished . Obama is basically telling Boehner to bet his career . Love it .

To be honest , as a biracial person ( black dad , white mom ) living in the Midwest , I 've never encountered any bigotry unique to my circumstance .

`` What we 're also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy. `` -- Obama 2013 .... reminds me of ..... `` Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected ... `` -- Obama 2011 This is why many of us railed against him from the beginning - he was , and remains , completely out of his league from a basic knowledge and experience perspective . He is not bright enough , not experienced enough , not intelligent enough and certainly not humble enough to understand and respect what he and his cohorts do not know . The administration as a whole acts like the classic first-year grad students who have this sudden epiphany about the utter simplicity of a solution to a long-standing problem that many others have attempted , and failed , to fix . But it turns out that grad student , more often than not , simply does n't have enough experience and/or understanding of the true nature of the problem to even begin to propose a solution , and concludes with nothing but a mess on the whiteboard . I find , as a conservative by nature , that I tend to hold back on broad promises , boastful solutions , and glamorous statements about fixing things until I have had time to sit and brood and analyze and assess and seek guidance and input from others . That has served me well in not looking like an asshole . Obama might want to try that some time .

I have said , and will continue to say , that she would be perfect for the position of President of the World bank . Jim Yong Kim 's term is up in 2017 , and if the Democrats win the Presidency in 2016 she has to be in consideration . Senator Warren has a deep knowledge of the banking system and the effects of loans on people in economic need . She has to be in consideration , and I think she could do a tremendous amount of good worldwide in that position .
This is such an excellent little sermon , thanks for posting it . The Reformation really is n't something to boast about , at least not yet . And it 's far from over .

I totally applaud the sentiment behind this , but I 'm very confused by the economics behind it . Why is it a good idea for , say , a toothbrush or a small child 's toy to be manufactured in Taiwan , shipped to a Canadian distribution centre , trucked to Walmart , bought by me , packed into a small box , and then flown to Afghanistan ? It does n't alleviate structural poverty in Afghanistan , it depresses any local market in small consumer goods , it 's a hugely inefficient way of distributing things , and it assumes that I , a rich , Western consumer , am the best person to decide what goods a child in Afghanistan really needs . If the point is to provide goods , why not buy in bulk ? Or better yet , invest in long term infrastructure and health improvements ?

People who do n't understand this are idiots . You ca n't claim your product can diagnosis , cure , mitigation , treatment , or prevention of disease unless it has been proven in clinical trials and approved for said use by the FDA . If you go through said process then your product is legally a drug and you can claim it does the things it is approved to treat . If you are n't willing to go through this process then you are making bullshit claims and you need to hire a marketing team that does n't have it 's head up its own rear .

Having spent hours in stopped traffic on routes that are 90 miles apart , and watching so many cars with a single rider in them , I think that we need to stretch ourselves a little and devise rail that is going to be faster and better than cars . I think that we need to tip our hats to the concept that buses are not the same experience as a car or a train - they are usually the equivalent of steerage because they are limited in size and thus ca n't offer amenities like snacks or the ability to stretch your legs . We need to try and understand the costs in a more equal manner - is the cost of building , maintaining , and patrolling our highways built in to any cost comparison when rail is deemed `` more expensive '' ? Or are the costs just less visible to cars , because you 're only thinking about the cost of gas to fill your tank ? Using federal reimbursement rates , the cost for a 90-mile car trip would be $ 50 one-way - that is the estimated cost of gas plus depreciation . Now assume that tolls are a fair approximation of the cost of maintenance of the highway - tolls can be $ 5-20 per car for the same trip ( including things like bridges ) . I just priced a 90-mile route and was quoted $ 21 by Amtrak . That means for up to about 3 people , rail is more cost-effective on its face - however that does neglect the cost to get to/from the stations . It is at least competitive for a party of 2 . The main problem is that the duration of the trip is over 3 hours . But does it have to be ? Why ca n't the train go 100 MPH ? That would cut travel down to a competitive level .

& gt ; '' After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states , it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage , '' the author said . `` No wonder President ( Barack ) Obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began. `` If this is widely known , should we not conclude that any pollster who predicted a Romney landslide must have been quite ill-informed and perhaps even criminally incompetent ?

My real problem with this is that the majority of those 144 were n't really voting to send the US into default . Only a total moron would do such a thing , and yes , there were probably a few of those . The rest just recognised that the vote would pass with or without them , and so had the freedom to vote against , thereby maintaining their ideological purity at no cost to the nation or consequences for themselves . They can parade this in front of the same assclowns who voted for them the first time around and ensure their re-election to carry on representing their gerrymandered district next time . As a demonstration of both flat-out cynicism and the dysfunction inherent in the US political system , it could n't really be much more perfect .

cpsc . gov/en/newsroom/news-releases/2012/new-cpsc-data-show-child-drownings-in-pools-and-spas-still-a-leading-cause-of-death/ That statistic seems questionable . Drownings are the number one or two cause of deaths for children , at 390 per year . npr . org/templates/story/story . php ? storyId=98055567 The report said traffic accidents , followed by drowning , fires and burns , falls , and poisoning , are the five major causes of unintentional injuries . About 830,000 children under 18 die every year , and millions more children suffer disabling injuries that could have been prevented , says Dr. Etienne Krug , the director of the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at WHO . Note that shootings does n't even make the top five .
Do you think there are democrats that would rather default on the nation 's debt than repeal the ACA ? Would you call them out as traitors ?

I am a youth minister . To some comments in this thread , I 'd like to respond . Youth ministry may have been absurd in Jesus ' day , you 're right , it did n't exist . ( And it does n't exist now- see the Andrew Root article linked below ) Neither did adolescence , and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day . Now , it is n't our job to prop up or indulge adolescence , quite the opposite . ( Andrew Root goes into detail on that huge point ) Yes , youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself , is not the church . Yes , a youth ministry that is a baby-sitting service , or making church a carnival so the kids wo n't leave , or making it a funeral so they wo n't mess up the church with their hijinks , is bad . Yes , like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success , youth can be bad . But there is a theology of youth ministry , thanks to folks like Kenda Creasy Dean ( kendadean . com ) and Andrew Root ( andrewroot . org ) that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations . Absolutely I think youth ministry MUST be intergenerational . As pastor , I am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships . Youth ministry is not the , but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church . At my church , our youth group acts as small group . We have our own worship on Wednesday , where they learn to lead and create and engage , to find their voice and get content , and contextualize , but we also do everything the greater church does . Taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because there 's no other option is sad for church kids , and disastrous for unchurched kids . Youth ministry IS `` letting the children come to Jesus '' I am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth , not a pastor solely for youth . With someone there to invest in them and relate to them , they have the full access an adult has to someone to disciple them and help them in their journey with God . Someone who has been to seminary , has made this their life 's work , not just someone doing it to `` help out. `` Not that that 's the end-all , but it 's what our adults get , is n't it ? My teenagers are equipped , they are within the larger church , they are called to be fully Christian , just like adults . I 'm not raising Diet Disciples . They are given adult mentors from the congregation . And they are living into that . Also , quick word on things like `` Divided. `` Divided comes with a lot of theological baggage and is almost predicated on the idea that the youth minister is a usurper of the father 's sovereign power over his family as the male leader . There are many more informed voices speaking on this subject who will raise better objections and questions , and leave us with better answers . I agree youth ministry must not become a golden calf , but it absolutely exists because of the way culture has designed itself . It is human person to human person relationship in Christ . It is not to be just one more problematic segregation in the church , but just because we give it a name does n't mean it has to something other than just `` ministry. ``

I think Kennedy would have defended Bush 's Iraq invasion . He escalated Eisenhower 's advisors to Vietnam . If he was willing to send men to die to fight communism I can easily see him supporting troops going to Afghanistan and Iraq , assuming he believed the `` intelligence '' provided to the UN by Colin Powell .
I really do n't get his thinking with this . He either thought this was actually true , which means he 's an utter moron , or he knows it was a huge lie which means he 's a complete piece of shit . Either way he looks bad eventually for saying this once the truth comes out so I 'm not sure what his end game was here .
I 've used a similar service called `` Can I Stream It ? `` ( canistream . it/ ) for awhile . The real takeaway from these services is that the answer is often `` no , you can't. `` My success rate for finding movies is maybe 50/50 and the rate for TV shows is closer to 10 % . As it stands , I have a 100 % success rate for movies and closer to 90 % rate for tv shows if I just pirate them . I do n't pirate because it 's free ( it 's not -- I pay for services ) , I pirate because the content is available there at all !

Agreed . There 's no reason to put people behind bars unless they 're a threat to society . If they 've got a drug problem , our tax dollars would be much better spent on their treatment rather than years behind bars where they cost us money rather than contribute tax dollars .

I think that aspect of the verse lacks punch because : 1 . Ordinary people make great sacrifices all the time . 2 . God can just snap his fingers and do or undo anything , so if his pie is burning , it 's hard to feel sorry for him . 3 . If we start talking about the Trinity in this context our brains will melt . So I think it 's hard to get hopped up on this verse . It reminds me of cases where a Christian has announced that Christ 's sacrifice was the greatest possible because crucifixion is the worst thing possible that can happen to anyone . I can name a few things that I would gladly submit to crucifixion in order to avoid . Hint : Mary endured one of those . TL ; DR : Adam is trying to start a circle jerk .
Yes I would .

This is an extraordinarily serious moment , one that deserves not to get lost in our pop culture milieu . Look , look at what we have leading us . Whom . Why does Wall Street support Obama ? Is their collective compensation increasing .... or decreasing ? Are they at risk of being unable to feed a hungry infant ? Look at massive health insurance companies , their premiums doubling while those in government squabble about website coding . Are they making more or less filthy lucre ? Are their executives at risk of being unable to feed a hungry child ? Oil companies ? Same , and no risk . So while millions of WORKING poor ... with the emphasis on working ... as in why should they be poor in a rich country .... while working . Before we even get to those unable to find work . There will be real fear afoot , hunger . Deprivation for untold millions of children , their families . While others ignore their plight . If Obama was the 'leftist ' or 'liberal ' he is accused of being ... this could NEVER happen . Yet , as per the reportage , it is about to happen . What a disgrace in a wealthy country that the 'fat ' that gets cut takes the food out of the mouths of children ...

I was very proud to be in Mr. Michaud 's congressional district during undergrad and I 'm very much looking forward to having him as governor of Maine . When he was my Congressman I did n't even know about his sexual orientation . It never even occurred to me to look into it . Why ? Because he 's a leader . I want him to be a good leader . I do n't need him to be a good lover , I do n't need him to be someone who 's into the same things in the bedroom that I am . I do n't care if he shares my sexual preferences or not - I genuinely do not care . I want him to be good at his job , and to advocate for a legislative platform that would benefit his constituents , period . Anything else is a distraction . From his record so far , I know that he 'll make an outstanding governor , certainly better than that clown Angus King .

& gt ; Contrary to the teachings of some faiths , atheists can express love . Atheists love their spouses and children . They experience awe and wonder . They appreciate beauty . They enjoy literature and poetry . Atheists who are materialists are not dry machines of logic , devoid of compassion .

I wish he would have added that saying these things are just god working through the atheists is sanctimonious and rude .

Humans are a social animal . Social animals function primarily as groups rather than as individuals . Therefore , any ideology that puts the individual first is not only an aberration in terms of future survival of the group , and ultimately the species , but it is logically incorrect as well .
Stossel is a piece of rancid cat shyte . Here 's a good rule of thumb for what should be privatized and what should n't . If you want to control the OUTCOME of a given situation , then socialization is the way to go . The whole raison d'etre for private enterprise is to make money , NOT provide whatever outcome you desire . Lets use the example of a sewage system . The outcome you want is basic sanitation for obvious reasons . Now , you can give that job to government , where the entire enterprise is set up to provide the service without having to make a profit . If you give that job to private business , their entire purpose is to make money . Making money takes precedence over providing the service . One of the primary ways to make money for the private enterprise is to NOT provide the service . So when the OUTCOME matters , it 's best to pool our resources as a society and bring down the price of the outcome we desire . Stossel and other conservatives ignore/reject this simple concept in the vague hopes that someone will be able to take more money from the American taxpayer than the government would in taxes to provide the service in the mistaken belief that privitazation generates more economic growth . Which even if true , does not negate that If privatization works so great , where are the all too obvious examples ? Halliburton is n't exactly a poster child for spending taxpayer dollars efficiently , is it ? The guys who lost their radioactive fracking waste along a texas highway ? The ones who said there 's no reason to hold down costs because they ; re all passed onto taxpayers ?

The Tea Party is the greatest gift to long term liberal wins ever
I have been listening to the proceedings as much as I can . Both sides have problems but the Republicams have one glaring issue that nobody is pointing out . They are not coming up with new arguments , rather they are taking every argument made by the democrats and using the same words to accuse back across the aisle . It 's a childish schoolyard game of `` I know you are but what am I ? `` One example : it was said the republicans were holding the government hostage . Today I heard a republican say democrats were holding jobs hostage . This all seems to me to be a highly engineered scheme by a faction to wreck havoc on the federal government . The Tea Party types want an anarchy and that is what they are on their way to creating . I would hope if this petition is our only way out from under Boehner 's gavel , that the 7 day option applies to this situation rather than the 30 day version .

The doctor who wrote this article provides several heartbreaking examples of her past patients that show the emergency room solution is no solution at all . FTA : & gt ; ... the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act ( EMTALA ) , which states that hospitals with emergency rooms have to accept and stabilize patients who are in labor or who have an acute medical condition that threatens life or limb . That word “ stabilize ” is key : Hospital ERs don ’ t have to treat you . They just have to patch you up to the point where you ’ re not actively dying . Also , hospitals charge for ER care , and usually send patients to collections when they can not pay . The disregard of the poor by the likes of Cruz is shameful . It is past time for a universal system .

This is pretty much exactly how a lot of liberals feel , and you wo n't find very many conservatives in America who agree with your viewpoint . Obama has stated ( before he was President ) that he would love to have a single payer system . What you describe is Obama 's ideal solution for healthcare . He did n't bother trying for single payer because he knew it would most likely die . There 's also an argument to be made that having single payer out of nowhere would be too drastic . The ACA acts as sort of a transition phase to smooth things out .

Walker turned in the aide that had embezzled which actually prompted the investigation into that issue , and was not charged with anything related to the aide that sent campaign-related emails while on the job , after extensive investigations into both issues . The author 's failure to look into these issues and subsequent noise about `` ethical clouds '' is shoddy . The only reason there are `` ethical clouds '' is because of journalists who re-state these unwarranted allegations to the casual news reader . If Walker violated some campaign law , rest assured that it will come to light ( because he has polarized his constituency and will be subjected to investigations for any allegations of scandal ... this being the third such investigation that I am aware of in his few years in office ) , but let 's not implicate him in two prior scandals that he was investigated for and cleared of in order to paint him with the guilty brush before this investigation is concluded .

Call me cynical but the fact that it has no plan for enforcement or penalties for non-compliance makes me think this is a rather obvious political ploy . Also seeing as it is left to local schools to come up with a way to accomplish this it would appear that they would be left to deal with any litigation and the resulting expenses at the local level . If this bill does pass , litigation is almost certain to follow and recent decisions make me think that it will be determined to be unconstitutional . Encouraging public schools to waste valuable education money on frivolous lawsuits strikes me as terribly irresponsible government .

Let be a little more intelligent here . Back in those days , having a child out of wedlock was socially unacceptable regardless of your religion or background . Those that did were stigmatized as 'whores ' . In fact , it was n't until 1973 that the Supreme Court ruled that fathers of illegitimate children had a legal responsibility to them . Different times . While the free love movement of the 1960s was starting to change that it did not have much of an impact on middle class America . Was n't just Catholic families . In the 1960s we went from 5 % out of wedlock births to our current rate of upwards of 40 % . Here is a blog that I thought was informative on this : wordpress . com/2013/04/04/how-we-came-to-embrace-illegitimacy/
I agree with you - the stronger the middle class , the better for our economy . The Democrats support the middle class and help the lower class with food and shelter . The Republican support of corporations and the rich help only a select few .
I once was a Young Earth Creationist because that is what I thought was the most literal understanding of the Bible . Struggling with the text for many years I eventually changed my opinion upon reading Genesis Unbound by John Sailhamer . Through this book I came to acknowledge that the meaning of Genesis 1 is not as clear as I once gathered . Therefore I am now a respecter of many views though holding to a form of Old Earth Creationism myself .
Agreed . Bet your own fucking paycheck , Boehner .

& gt ; Well , one of the reasons some Americans feel they ’ re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes , which are low compared to other modern countries , and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries — a lot of our health care costs , higher education costs , admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things — lo and behold , we end up being a relatively high-tax country . I 've been saying this for years and it never seems to sink in . To fairly compare taxes in the U. S. with other countries you have to add in the costs of healthcare and college . Corporations corrupting the tax code is a different discussion . The cost of healthcare in America is also a different discussion . Healthcare is more expensive here because we pay geometrically more for the same services .
The problem I have with lists like this is that their scope is so limited . They target Christian Biblical literalism as the reason for rejecting all religions . There is nothing mentioned about the claims being unproven , just objections that are straw men for any sophisticated believer . It almost seems like any rigorous , non literal interpretation of scripture could easily pull this kind of atheist back into the fold .
Conservative viewpoints should be a natural response to a country with financial problems , like we have now . Unfortunately , the current crop of republicans in office very often look like ignorant bible thumpers ( not saying there are n't exceptions , but this is how the republican party is often preceived ) , which scares the hell out of a lot of people , especially the younger ones like myself .
To that pastor : You 're completely right . We have better things to do than debate what goes on between two adults in their bedroom . So mind your own fucking business and stop opposing allowing secular legal marriages between two consenting adults .

Yep . He just lost . Did he really just respond to `` Hey we can help kids with cancer '' by saying `` look I have people at nellis sitting at home '' ? And what is stuck in his throat ? Jesus turn your head from the mic before coughing up a lung . Anyway , I thought Obama 's schtick was that he is a pragmatic , not an absolutist leader . The conditions you find yourself in are that the government is shut down . You have the option of at least working with Republicans to get the NiH going again . Why not do it ? You worked with Republicans to keep the military funded , why ca n't you do the same for the NiH ? And please oh please stop with the `` enough is enough '' and `` talk about reckless '' and so on . Such statements add zero value and inhibit cooperation .
This is pathetic , on so many levels . Imagine the subconscious emotional pressure your brain is under , when your significant other is trying to convert . Surely , in the back ( or front ) of your mind is the idea , `` If I do n't convert , he 's going to leave me. `` But , besides that , here is the unique person on Earth you are bonded to , and they are pushing this dogma on you . A weak ego is going to cave like an eggshell . Plus , she was n't an atheist . She never considered the proposition `` God : Yes or No ? `` in any clarified manner . She took her religion from her `` super-smart '' father and let it lie as it was ... until her boyfriend hatched his conversion plans on her . Plus , she has never been exposed , apparently , to secular speakers , or psychologists , who deal with human issues from a non-religious viewpoint : & gt ; `` But then the pastor preached . I was fascinated . I had never heard a pastor talk about the things he did. `` Meditation can be a wonderful thing . But then a priest comes in , slaps a `` prayer '' label on it and makes it icky . She apparently went through this brainwashing process for 8 months , all the while being coached by her boyfriend , and after all that , she ... has a dream . That 's all the rigorous proof anyone needs , right : & gt ; '' My boyfriend would pray with me for God to reveal himself to me . After about eight months of going to hear Keller , I concluded that the weight of evidence was on the side of Christianity . [ ... ] I continued to think that people who talked of hearing from God or experiencing God were either delusional or lying . [ ... ] Then one night on a trip to Taiwan , I woke up in what felt like a strange cross between a dream and reality . Jesus came to me and said , `` Here I am. `` This testimony is one of the most sad and pathetic things I 've ever read regarding a conversion . ( Well , I guess it could 've been more pathetic : scientist Francis Collins ' conversion occurred when he which reminded him of the Trinity . )
They are prepping her for the next election . A few days ago something was posted regarding her husband , Bill Clinton , saying that people should be able to keep their plan if they want to . Now I think that this is a clear tactic used to try and separate Hillary from the Obama administration without them saying she is against them . Now the trick is that she is not really against him , rather , she is being the typical dem and abandoning ship to benefit herself . Im calling it right now , there will be a rather subtle divide between her and the Obama admin . His declining approval rating is cancerous to her campaign and she is going to start making distance .
This raised my blood pressure a considerable degree
IMO , this website debacle is a distraction . Eventually , the site will be fixed and we will all be forced to do business with an insurance company ( of all types of companies , these are my least favorite to deal with ) .

This is definitely a problem with blogging style journalism . They likely do n't go through editors before hitting the screen , because on nearly EVERY article these days `` these are the views of such and such , and not our company '' to protect them ... because they do n't check their work .
It 's hard to come up with a concise reason why the US is as loony as it appears to be . Its like a combination of willing ignorance , lack of leadership , and the glorification of selling people out for your own profit . There are other reasons too , they are just escaping my train of thought for the moment . That all said , despite all the gloom and doom that every talking head is trying to earn a buck from , consider that things have been worse . People have been rounded up , dressed in attractive uniforms , armed with firearms and then marched off to a field in northern France to be ground into mulch . People have dropped in droves from the flu . There has been wholesale eradication of people solely because they prayed to the same God but in a different way . Amongst all that we collectively still found time to rip people off , poison , and rape them . That is just the 20th century . What we have now is trivial by comparison .

What they do n't tell you in this article is that all of the sweatshop labor that goes into producing these uniforms is carried out by a company called UNICOR that pays convicts pennies an hour to do work that should be done by all of the hard working American citizens that ca n't find jobs right now . There is n't any way to make money in prison unless you work for them and when they feed you bullshit you have to be able to get money on your books to survive . This is new world slave labor at it 's finest .
Conservatives have been making a concerted effort to turn r. politics more red for as long as its been a subreddit . The recent mod actions are part of that .

It 's a shame that the author perpetuates the myth of Mother Teresa , but otherwise a good article .
This story makes no mention of the 2013 election and only once mentions Hassan Rouhani ! I mean wtf it 's not like there is only side on a negotiation table . Its like when conservatives credit Ronald Reagan with the end the cold war without a mention of Mikhail Gorbachev 's reforms Perestroika and Glasnost . I think having a more moderate leader in Iran is a bigger reason for progress with them then anything any secretary could do .
Then do n't re-elect them .
I love how the reasoning for why it should be illegal is because early use in kids makes them more susceptible to drug abuse later . The law would clearly state the the persons would need to be 21 to buy it just like the case is with alcohol . Why are they more worried about the drug use that would stem from marijuana ( a less addictive drug than alcohol ) yet blatantly ignore both the alcoholism and drug use that can come from early drinking . Maybe its because there is n't as much of a connection because of the social aspects associated with drinking . Would n't marijuana go through the same thing alcohol did when it became legal , more social acceptance and knowledge of the drug allowing for more conversations between kids and their parents about the right way to do these things without leading to increased hardcore drug use .

& gt ; As the only socially transformational legislation in modern American history to be enacted on a straight party-line vote , Obamacare is wholly owned by the Democrats . Its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of ever-expansive central government providing cradle-to-grave care for an ever-grateful citizenry . & gt ; For four years , this debate has been theoretical . Now it ’ s real . And for Democrats , it ’ s a disaster . & gt ; This is the signature legislative achievement of the Obama presidency , the embodiment of his new entitlement-state liberalism . If Obamacare goes down , there will be little left of its underlying ideology . & gt ; Perhaps it won ’ t go down . Perhaps the Web portal hums beautifully on Nov. 30 . Perhaps they ’ ll find a way to restore the canceled policies without wrecking the financial underpinning of the exchanges . & gt ; Perhaps . The more likely scenario , however , is that Obamacare does fail . It either fails politically , renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of Democrats , or it succumbs to the financial complications ( the insurance “ death spiral ” ) of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it . & gt ; If it does fail , the effect will be historic . Obamacare will take down with it more than Mary Landrieu and Co . It will discredit Obama ’ s new liberalism for years to come .

Its not surprising that this article takes an anti-investor stance , and is chock full of misleading information . It 's a slow day at work today , so I thought I 'd write a few bullet points as I was reading through it : 1 . Blackstone is n't `` owned '' by any of those banks listed . The fancy sounding SEC filing is just a list of who owns Blackstone 's common stock ( ticker : BX ) . The list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage , which means if you as a normal person buy for example the JPMorgan Large Cap Value Mutual Fund , you own a portion of those BX shares , which gets aggregated in that list . Not so evil ... 2 . The reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter , and safer . There are no more zero money down purchases . If you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans , then you ca n't also blame them for now not giving these loans . 3 . The `` besuited businessmen '' paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close . These companies like Blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks , or at large auctions . Not so evil . 4 . After buying the houses , they are hiring property management companies , contractors , and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible ( within 90 days ) . That 's literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most . 5 . Blackstone is n't `` speculating on housing prices '' , looking to quickly flip them , or creating another housing bubble . The key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties . These are all houses that already exist , and they are simply fixing them back up , and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way . 6 . Most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now . They do n't have 20 % savings to put down , they are probably living check to check . But their family and kids are used to living in a house , in a neighborhood . They do n't want to move into a 1 bedroom apartment building . Now Blackstone comes in , and offers the opportunity to stay in a house , with the same schools , etc . This is n't predatory . People are paying rent , but now they have the option to do so while living in a house . 7 . Now that all these houses are owned by Blackstone , they are in no hurry to `` flip '' them for profit , because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them . The new boilers , new roof , and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability . Most leases are 2 years , so there is n't constant turnover , and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect . 8 . Eventually , the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company , and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work ( See the recent IPO of SilverBay : SBY ) . The company will continue to own and operate the homes , pay income to shareholders , and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do . The exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multi-family apartment real estate investing . Not so evil . Ultimately , this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes . While renting they can continue to save , and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budget . Hopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what Blackstone and other institutional investors are doing , rather than just shake their fists and yell `` Damn Wall Street , Republicans , and Obama ! `` . There was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where I stopped reading .
Thank you for this , good sir .

You realize his constituents are the entire state of Texas , right ? He won 56 % of the vote , which means at least 44 % of us are n't insane . And more people are coming to our side all the time . Just look at the Houston Chronicles '

Surely though , the point could be not `` Let 's not have any love and grace to this pastor , '' but `` You need to have love and grace , because if you do n't have love and grace , you 'll wind up doing something loveless and graceless , for example what this pastor said . If you think that 's bad , then be more loving and gracious. ``

Because they no longer teach civics in schools , people forget that the dissension in the US government exists as a self-healing balance , so that no one entity , person or party , becomes too powerful . If too many disagree , it ca n't be good for the majority . If enough agree , it is likely good for the majority . It is only when enough people agree , that anything happens . The US government structure has these fail-safes built in , and dissension until compromises are reached is what makes final agreements work .

Alright , as a teen I 'm going to share my experience with youth ministry . I go to the Life Teen program at my church almost every Sunday and we 're a really tight knit group there . We actually have deep discussions , instead of just fun and games , and we have an annual summer retreat which is what I always look forward to in the summer . A lot of the people in the head Youth Ministry office in the archdiocese went to and were leaders of this specific Life Teen . We frequently do things to help out our church community from service projects , to raising money . Teens who go to this Llife Teen seem more mature and very involved in the church . I would n't be who I am today without this program .

He did n't put her there . The republican party did as a concession to the `` tea party '' in hopes of controlling them . They have since lost control which can be seen within American Politics and the Republican party is split over it . Let us hope the 2014 election season sees it fixed .
I want to solely blame Fox News for the reason our current political climate sucks so much , but then I remember that the Reagan/Clinton shift right happened well before Fox News ever existed .

Saw the same type of thing last year , guess what ? Walmart is a greedy corporation just like any other and will never change . They do n't care about the workers .

I believe it would be right cool if the Democrats just took over the position of 'conservative ' party . They do all the consertive stuff quite well -- pandering to big money , spying on citizens , grossly mismanaging public resources . The U. S. has n't had a progressive party for many years .
This Massachusetts liberal did so much harm to the Conservative cause it is n't even funny . He single-handedly allowed Obama and the socialist party to move the Overton window so far left that real conservatism is n't even recognizable in the public discourse .

Schooling needs to give kids a taste of things and find out what they like , are good at , and enjoy . Everything in your post could be applied to any subject in school , be it maths , sciences , history , social studies , etc . I think it 's pretty flabby that we have art , and phys ed , but not something like basic programming . Programming is one of the backbones in modern society , and becoming more so every year . We really should n't continue on this path of producing children who know little about computers besides operating their iDevices , browsing the web , and some gaming . I 've read a lot of assessments suggesting that kids today are less literate than kids who were born in the 80 's . It 's all well and good that we 've turned computing into a basic commodity like we did with cars . Unlike cars though , there are dozens of millions of jobs that require high level computing knowledge , programming skills , problem solving , etc . Not knowing how your car works or how to fix it is n't closing huge amounts of doors to you or possibly limiting your career potential in many industries .

I 've recently run into these problems with my current pastor . I was talking to him about metaphorical interpretations of certain passages in the bible that have been traditionally read literally . When I questioned him about why he believes these passages to be literal , when all history and evidence points to it being metaphorical , he basically told me , that 's just how it is , and that I do n't have to analyze it too much . He told me he 's studied this before , he has references to `` prove it '' , and because that 's what he believes . In other words , he told me to shut up and stop asking questions . To me , it 's an insult to intelligence when someone tells me to stop thinking and just believe what 's in front of me .

Yes , the minority can force a vote to be called by getting 215 ( ? ) reps to sign a Discharge Petition . The only problem is that it takes something like a month before the Discharge Petition comes into effect , meaning a vote would n't be held until November . I think we can be sure that Boehner will cave before then . At least I hope so .
because Obama is thin skinned
People believe in God because they 've been trained to . Being scared of death plays some role in it . Needing to believe that one 's own personal successes and failures wo n't completely dictate their future plays some part in it . But mostly it ’ s because they ’ ve been trained to based on generations of religion seeping into politics and society .

Sadly , while he is reformed , those bad calls from his youth will haunt him for the rest of his life . I mean , I have some Tea Party folks on my f'list that do respond to facts . But the Jesus Conservatives just do n't .
That escalated quickly .
We got the same Gospel you got . Christ crucified and risen .
The Pope 's a Christian who has actually read the New Testament . Funny that the religious right just started a new push to strengthen support from Catholics .

You know , I have no problem with people paying taxes , nor does it bother me that the rich pay 20 % . We all should pay that or less . What bothers me is when the tax money we already collect is spent on billionaires , military equipment the military begs us to stop buying , and myriad other bullshit that does not serve the taxpayers and THEN they ask for MORE !

I LOVE IT ! there is lot of people , that may have trouble interacting with other people face to face , but are not afraid to say basically anything on the internet . why not cherrypick and meet people that like the same ideas as you that go to the same pub or gym as you do . come on reddit - you should know it 's going to be fucking amazing !
I 'm not calling him progressive until he at least openly discusses the Vatican 's policy of covering up charges of child molestation .
Well .. is that really the case ? Because I was under the impression they have to vote in the best interests of their voters , not vote for what their voters claim to want right ? If the reality is the voters are so misinformed that what they want , and what is in their best interests are n't the same ... should a representative vote in their best interest or for what their ignorant voters are screaming for ? Honest question ...
Which means a lot of `` superior '' officers are complicit .
The city government I work for is doing the same thing ... or at least , was until this debacle over Obamacare started ... and the mayor leaves this week to go work for Obama and I have no idea what the next mayor/ city council will do .
I am an atheist and a very proud graduate of Texas A & amp ; M. However this is the hardest part of being an A & amp ; M grad . It has such a religious influence because of the area and the high numbers of catholic ( and other Christian ) students . I read stuff like this and it makes me cringe . However , I was a science major at A & amp ; M and I NEVER once encountered any sort of religion from any professor or any student . This needs to stop though . This guy needs to go teach at Liberty or something . Gig 'em !

Back in grade school when I was still a believer this would bother me so much . Christian schools , youth groups , family get-togethers , where ever I was it was always uncomfortable watching people jump at the chance to lead prayer or throwing out prayer requests just to be part of something . Listening to someone use `` Lord '' as a filler in prayer just as you 'd use `` Um '' or `` Like '' . Or , god forbid , when I was `` volunteered '' for it . What was I supposed to do ? I know they were just trying to include me and I do n't want to start a debate on the ethics of public prayer right before we eat . It 's not even an obscure verse either . It 's in the first gospel . You ca n't even say that it was only applicable for it 's time and place . Like , half of Jesus 's mission was preaching against the pretentious self righteousness of the religious leaders . Trying to cut through the bullshit and make religion more personal . To this day it bothers me . It 's like , if you 're going to be all religiousy then at least FOLLOW YOUR OWN DAMN RELIGION .
Why are GMOs considered so bad ?
So you need either a Google+ account or a YouTube channel to comment on videos , but if you make a YouTube channel it automatically makes you a Google+ account ? They are desperately trying to get people to use Google+ . Stop it , it 's not going to happen .

I could only get to the second page . The author needs an editor really bad . I get it , we should be working harder to get political control over the money machine . Tea Party Bad . The second half of the first page ended with ( possibly ) calling the reader a dick . Shorten it , look hard at places where you use a lot of exclamation marks . Your writing style is annoying .
I really wish it were true , but I 'm pretty skeptical .
I 'm glad there 's some reasonable people still around here . At the same time Cruz was filibustering , countless other Senators were meeting with lobbyists or at the bar getting sauced - Cruz certainly earned his salary more than they did .
Very creepy . Teachers should get fired for this inane idea . Politics has no place in the classroom . Very jingoistic .
Dollar figure , not % of GDP . So long as inflation keeps occurring , the deficit is going to trend upwards . Still , they are among the largest deficits as a percent of GDP as well , outside of WW1 and WW2 .

This is even worse than the Texas roadside Ass to Vagina episode a while back . Clearly , these cops were on a power trip as no rational person would go to such lengths to confiscate the amount of drugs Mr. Eckert could have possibly been hiding in his rectum . The fact that a cop can say you were clenching your buttcheeks and then have such an extensive search done on your person is frightening .
I 'm starting to think it might be a good idea to organize a response group to deal with people downvoting the new submissions on /r/progressive . I keep seeing brand new posts downvoted long before someone could have read the article . In this case , it was within 4 minutes of submitting .
It 's really crazy . I liked looking at how many countries had debt as greater than 100 % of their GDP .

If memory serves the inventor is cool as fuck as well , used the money to start his own lab to do further development on pretty cutting edge science . Good for him .
They 're piggybacking off the U. S. in 2 ways that make their system work . 1 . They rely on the U. S. to provide their defense for them , freeing up resources to pay for their social programs . Were those countries required to provide adequate defense for themselves , you 'd see quite a few of their social programs be thrown over the side . 2 . The U. S. creates and invents the vast majority of new drugs , treatments and medical devices the rest of the world uses .
Are the people questioning 3d printers because they have n't read the article . I 'm new , but just asking . I believe in the power of this . Never underestimate some type of technology . This happens to be a game changer . Yes , you heard it here first .
This has been the modus operandi of the GOP since Obama was elected - it 's time to clear out the dance floor .
I. am . mad . Conservatives said this would be what would happen . Obama said everybody who wants to keep their insurance can keep their insurance . Conservatives said that would be impossible . King Barry and his minions called the Conservatives liars . He said over and over that everyone who wanted to keep his own health insurance plan could . Well , this article from the conservative outlet CBS , Not only says That millions are going to be forced to give up I hope insurance plan they want to keep , But that King Barry and his administration has known that since 2009 . Stinking M. A. D .
If this was actually going to make Christianity popular , it would 've done it the first time around , or the second , or the third ... or you know , any one of the thousands of times throughout history this garbage was brought up and thoroughly debunked .
Whatever faith I might have had in Ted Cruz is completely , utterly , gone . He somehow forgets what a democracy means and wants everything his way . He 's like a little kid who threatens to take his ball and go home . In my book , he has already committed political suicide . I 'm sure he 'll make plenty of bucks on the book and speaking circuit .
How about staving off decline with Christ ? If your church has the exact same values as the rest of the world a crap-ton of restrictions with seemingly no benefit , then why on earth would someone go there ?
`` From Wall Street to K Street to Pennsylvania Avenue , we find special interests increasingly exempted and insulated – by law - from the rigors of competition and the consequences of their own mistakes , '' Lee said . `` All of this points to what really is an inequality crisis in America today – a crisis not of unequal wealth or income… but unequal opportunity . Progressives , from the president on down , say that inequality in America today is a failure of the free market , resulting from insufficient government intervention . But if you look closely , you start to notice , the opposite is true. `` Good stuff there .
`` Remember , these days , liberals can see racism in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. `` Now THATS funny .
They got what they wanted from the troops .

I 'm not a fan of abstinence education anyway , but assuming you want it to work ... You know how long telling people `` You 'll definitely get an STD the first time you sleep with someone. `` will keep people abstinent ? Right up until they work out that you wo n't definitely get an STD the first time they sleep with someone . You know how long telling people `` You have a four times better chance of a happy marriage if you 're a virgin when you get married. `` will last ? My guess is until they 've asked a couple of searching questions . And saying that `` Condoms are only 95 % effective. `` and pretending that 's nothing ( and the 95 % rate seems to come from a study where a bunch of participants had n't been taught how to use them ) is dangerous . When kids figure out you 're lying to them , they 're gon na stop trusting you .
It 's always struck me as odd , how the libertarians and tea-baggers have almost no respect for intellectual property rights . I think it 's the aversion to `` intellect '' .
I do n't think many people would argue that we should n't read the Qu'ran . At most , these articles say : if you want to understand Islam , do n't only read the Qu'ran . There are a lot of hadiths , and scholarly rulers , history and tradition in Islam as well .
I am so sick and tired of the whole `` media cabal '' bullshit excuse . The notion that the solution to the supposed problem is to fire 90 % of editors and hire ones you `` ca n't control '' is just plainly stupid . There are surely sources of news that are better than others . If you rely on 24-hour cable news channels like CNN , MSNBC and Fox News as your sole sources of news , then yes - you deserve constant ridicule . If you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you , you deserve being ignored . If you get all your political news from one political perspective , you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a fact-oriented discussion . Those people are the problem . They 're the ones that resort to making claims of `` mainstream media bias '' which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion . But what about us readers who rely on SEVERAL sources to make our conclusion ! ? On Syria for example , I read the Washington Post , Guardian , Reuters , AP , al Jazeera , CNN . com and several other sources . I heard about the Administrations ' claims of intelligence implicating the Syrian regime , of Putin 's claims that it was the rebels , I followed the U. N. 's report findings through the Washington Post . I followed the story as Obama brought it to Congress , the pros/cons , the opinion polls , arguments for and against a strike , the videos of children dying from the Sarin . I am more informed these days than ever before , so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow . He just comes across as some pissed off guy . A cynic without a compelling argument . The point is , I am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like Hersh that they 're all `` in the pockets of Obama. `` Let me ask you this Mr. Hersh : what publication is your shining example of journalism ? You sure as hell did n't say . Who sets the standard on reporting excellence ? Well , the Guardian lends you credibility by noting your Pulitzer Prize . You 're one of the good guys . So who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of International Reporting ( that he later derides in the article ) ? From the past decade : 2013 - NY Times 2012 - NY Times 2011 - NY Times 2010 - Washington Post 2009 - NY Times 2008 - Washington Post 2007 - Wall Street Journal 2006 - New York Times 2005 - LA Times and Newsday 2004 - Washington Post 2003 - Washington Post 1970 - Dispatch News Service ( Seymour M. Hersh ) So my two most preferred publications ( NYT & amp ; WP ) dominate the Pulitzer prize for international reporting . Fire 90 % of these editors ! ? It 's trite nothingness . Any fool can cast stones at an entire profession , but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles , some editors , some authors ? He indicates a systemic problem but ca n't even get close to substantiating it ! Seriously , those who agree with Mr. Hersh - what news source is your beacon of truth ? What organizations and people are the standard bearers that the rest of the `` pathetic '' media should aspire to be ? I really want to know , because this type of bullshit generalization is a cheap and empty tactic .

Because I 've seen this article 10 million times over the past 2 days , I 'm just assuming she did it for attention , not because she 's genuinely a nutjob .
The video is a little sketchy at first in the way it refers to atheists but it goes on to clarify this point . She goes from talking about anger at `` God '' to people who are angry at organized religion which are 2 completely different things .
& gt ; he even says we could eliminate currency , and just barter for things I 'd like to see the comment you 're talking about because I doubt he would say that . What he probably said is that we could eliminate the coercive monopoly on currency ( e. g. legal tender laws ) and still be able to trade with each other just fine . He 's a voluntaryist , so he 's obviously fine with currencies that people use voluntarily ( e. g. bitcoin , private currency , silver ) not ones that the government forces you to use . Government forces you to claim your income in dollars and they force you to accept them as payment . That 's a lot different that wanting to do away with currency ; an ancap would never say that .
I think there 's some truth to this . You really have to be divorced from the reality of how religious thought works not to realize that religious conservatism is an incubator for irrationalism and therefore for all sorts of stupidity and ignorance . It is not a coincidence that people who come from a place of heavy-handed orthodoxy , superstition , and tribalism in religion tend to espouse a particularly irrational , brutal politics .

I remember that ! S. Korea , right ? I was in the Navy at the time and a few shipmates and I went out drinking after pulling into port there . Do n't remember what city though . Anyhow during our bar hopping , some guy hands us a flier like that talking about end-of-world crap and all . Threw it away . Sometime later read about it in Stars-n-Stripes that the leader was a Harold Camping type and people ( S. Koreans ) were all selling their stuff awaiting the second coming .
Conservative voters in Texas are quiet but they always show up to the polls . Texas wo n't be blue for a long time .
Is it just me , or is the idea of ANY judge , at any level , deciding any case before them based on there own personal viewpoints utterly ridiculous ? A judges decisions should be made entirely on the facts and arguments presented to them on a case by case basis . The bench is not a place for judges to inject there own views , political or social or religious or anything . Judges bought and paid for by either political party or big business is what is undermining the very principals this country was founded on and looks to be destroying any future this country has .
Id venture to say the 'majority of Christians ' dont even think that far into it , or have even heard of transhumanism Myself , I do n't trust it . Makes me think of the serpents promise in Genesis 3 .
Funny how I 've been told by Democrats to shut my whore mouth every time I predict he 'll do this type of stuff . Then after the fact , they say his hands were tied and he had no choice .

Feinstien is neither R or D. She is a corporatist . The Corporate State is who she serves . She has always been well rewarded and will face no state sanctioned punishment unless she publicly challenges it or offends someone who is more powerful .
I do n't wish it on America but I honestly think that until generations suffer from a kind of oppression they will do nothing to prevent it . we had a generation oppressed in this way . They got tired of it . They changed things . They taught their children to understand the importance of that change . Those children taught their children about it but it was a generation removed . Then those children sort of forgot about it , feeling that progress was made and now those things need n't be worried about . So those children didnt really teach their children about it at all . And now we have a generation that has forgotten entirely . History may be cyclical for that reason . Sadly , change takes more generations and if the union system vanishes now , it will be quite some time before workers can be free and safe again . So , no , I do n't wish it on us -but it may also be inevitable .

This is much better ( And with much better sources and description from your experience ) what I was going to say . The problem is n't that youth ministry is killing the church , it is that using different ministries to separate the church is killing the church into youth , seniors , couples , singles , etc without bringing them back together that is killing the church .
My job offered this but not enough people signed on so they never implemented it . You got to pick a day and work 4 10 's the rest of the week , if too many people signed up for one day some would have to pick another day . I could n't do it because I had to pick up my daughter at certain times . Now we have flex time and I try to get in at 7:00 so I can leave at 3 . I wish they would make it total flex time allowing us to work extra and it counts towards the same week or leave early and make up for it the next day .
I 'm gon na call him up and act like this is the greatest idea in the world and that he 's a political genius for doing it .. after I rope him in , hit him with `` Putting Allah in all public schools is amazing ! `` just to hear him cringe . If only for my own personal amusement .
This has nothing to do with it being Texas , and everything to do with Texas A & amp ; M being run by religious nutjobs . There are many excellent universities in the state of Texas that teach science correctly .

I am a Young Earth Creationist , but I 've never truly looked into it . As far as I know ( this is an extremely dumbed-down version ) , scientists look at rocks and their natural processes today and use that to estimate how old the earth is . However , they assume that the rocks natural processes were always like this , and they are not taking in the account of a possible global flood that may have lasted roughly a year ( Yes , I know if you are Atheist you more than likely do n't believe this story to be true ) .
Single payer kills administrative overhead . No opt out kills stratification . Collective pressure to reduce the cost of services benefits the consumer AND the taxpayer . I think I must be in support of socialized medicine .
( probably going to be buried , but I need to say my piece ) & gt ; Second , everyone struggles with hypocrisy , you find it everywhere . It 's just more obvious and glaring in the case of people who despise the ones their religion tells them to love and to help . Christianity I think makes this especially hard . The `` ask '' it makes of people is impossibly big - not only should you not sleep with someone else 's spouse , you should n't even look at them and feel lust ; not only should you follow all the rules , but you should also give all you have to the poor ; not only should you care for your family , but you should also embrace all those you despise . So basically , nobody - with the exception of Jesus - lived an actual `` good '' life . Everyone is a sinner . You ca n't possibly live up to the standard set by Christian ethics . At the same time , Christianity gives you what is oft interpreted as a `` get out of jail free '' card . Act like a dick on your commute ? Ask God for forgiveness , Jesus has paid the price ! Feel weird about buying produce picked by teenage migrant workers for below minimum wage ? `` The poor shall always be with you , '' and besides , God forgives you ! You are one of God 's chosen ! You will join the Saints in heaven ! In some Christians , the combination of always-sinner and always-saint produces a result . In some other Christians , people figure you ca n't help being a jackass so you might as well not feel bad about it .

Social conservatives want it both ways . They want women to stay home , to not use bc , to not vote , to stfu . Then they do n't want to help those women , complain that they have too many kids , complain about `` who is raising '' their kids , want to get rid of the minimum wage and on and on . Every time one of them tells me about big government my immediate retort is `` yes , big government is a problem ; they are in my cooch and in my bedroom '' shuts them up right off .
Secular `` humynist '' LOL !
A lot of people do n't realize that there are more options than just a single payer system . A single payer system would be something like the UK or Canada has , but other countries provide near universal coverage through other means . France and Germany still have many private health insurance companies but they provide coverage to all of their citizens . The biggest problem with American health care is that the insurance companies are for-profit . Administrative costs are often over 20 % for insurance companies in America , while in places like France and Germany it is only around 5 % or so .
My concern is that it 's not indexed to inflation or the cost of living . Without that , the state legislature will be able to kick the can down the road on minimum wage hikes for as long as they want . $ 10 dollars an hour is n't that much . The federal minimum wage in 1968 was $ 10 . 68 ( inflation adjusted ) , and that does not include productivity gains . With that included , it would be above $ 20/hr . While I am not one to support a rise to such a level ( $ 20/hr may be too extreme ) , I believe a rise to around $ 12-13/hr indexed to inflation would be good . It would also fit with California 's historical image of being a leader among the rest of the states .

& gt ; Do n't post mean comments , this fellow is genuinely scared of his government This fellow was caged for a year by the thugs you revere . No shit he 's scared , justifiably so . The question is how come you , presumably an adult , are not scared of people who feel justified in ruining you if you disobey them ?
Also , I 'm pretty sure surveys have shown that marijuana is easier for kids to currently obtain than alcohol and even tobacco . If anything , the argument could be made that legalizing marijuana and regulating it would make it harder for kids to obtain .
Assuming that the government will automatically balance itself out is terribly dangerous . There is little to no indication that the country will ever be able to change anything about the electoral process at this point , even though the two-party system we have has shown to be a staggeringly poor method for representing Americans or for preventing corruption .
That 's what I 'll call my rifle .
The quick and dirty : [ the judge ] sentenced Carri Williams to 37 years in prison . Her husband Larry , convicted of lesser charges , was sentenced to just under 28 years . Both terms are well above the standard sentencing range .

Considering President Obama 's first term began in the throes of the Great Recession and recovery stimulus was compromised down to be less effective , it should have been clear to all from this beginning what the conservative goals were , and what they were willing to do to achieve them .
I think `` money in politics '' is not the whole problem , and is probably the minor portion of the problem . The problem , in my opinion , is that politics is a viable career choice in America right now . Rather than running to do the work of the people , politicians run to spend their lives in the Senate and enjoy all the power and prestige that comes with belonging to that club , then retire with a huge pension and ridiculous benefits . Governance should be a sacrificial act of public service . I 'm not necessarily saying it should be volunteer work , but I think congressional salaries should be greatly reduced , fringe benefits ( e. g. health care , retirement pensions , etc . ) should be eliminated and term limits should be implemented . D. C. needs to stop being Hollywood for ugly people and transform into a meeting place where folks who carry burdens for their communities and this nation come to create or remove laws to improve those communities and our nation as whole , and then they should return home to live in the cesspits or havens they created .
The result is that God is love , and he does everything in love . The problems that arise where people get really torn down to their very fiber is the people who are unrepentant evil . In a way it is a glimpse at hell , where everyone is unrepentant evil and there is no love . God has no mercy on evil , but his people that do evil he eventually has mercy on . Jesus comes around in the New Testament and forgives us of our sins . I do have trouble reading the Old Testament a bunch like watching a movie where people are doing stupid things , '' Do the right thing ! `` is what is in your head . `` Stop being so stupid and evil '' you say to yourself . Then you watch as God really tears people down to their core and awful things occur . God would n't have brought them to that point if there was any other way for God is a loving God . The very cries you have for people in the Bible to `` Stop being so very stupid , sinful , and evil. `` is valid for personal reflection though . It is helpful for resisting personal temptation to take a corrupt path .
And it has for thousands of years . It 's people like those in this article who are misguided if they think a book by a 16 year old could actually pose a legitimate threat . A core part of Islam is in fact questioning its validity , because if you follow something blindly , you cant possibly understand it .
It 's not about making up rules as you go along , as if this is some sort of wishy-washy foolishness . These are very rich , very powerful , and very dangerous people . This is not spontaneous and it is not coincidence . The system is rigged , and has been for a long time . While the public rages back and forth against the other 'team ' , Congress has been quietly implementing baby steps . Now it 's out in the open , but is it too late ?

Yeah , the notion that any party would die is pretty absurd anyway , in the end you just have constituencies shuffle around a bit but the `` Republican '' and `` Democrat '' parties wo n't go anywhere anytime soon . I do think that the Tea Party could die as a result of this though , or at least be cut off from the mainstream Republican party that they have latched onto . The problem is that the fringe Tea Party members in the public seem to think that they really are the majority , but since they are n't they 're likely to overstep the bounds of public opinion like they are currently doing with the shutdown over ObamaCare . The mainstream Republicans are trying to bail them out right now to cover their own ass but I think once the Republicans lose the next presidential election due to all the infighting in their party spurred on by the Tea Part that they will stop placating the Tea Party and start fighting it for real . If they 're smart they could shun the Tea Party and make them the right wing party to the Democrat 's left wing party while presenting the classic mainstream Republican party as the moderate party .

Here 's the definition from the article : `` Egonovism is the belief in a god and/or a religious structure that is not determined by holy text , organized religion , or religious leaders . It is the Egonovists themselves who determine the religious doctrine . Essentially , they make up the rules , and they decide how to follow them . It is likely that a statistically large number of self-identified Christians fall into the Egonovism category . They may not even be aware of it , but they ’ ve reconstructed Christian doctrine in a way that makes sense to them . Ignoring some parts deemed bad or irrelevant , embracing other areas containing relevant wisdom , and then filling in the blanks with their own ideas . It ’ s not just Christians who do this ; people from every major religion living in Western society do the same thing. ``

Effective camouflage patterns are n't bullshit . I think UCP ( the grey/green digital pattern ) was bullshit and somebody probably lined a pocket or two in the process . But a corrupted system should not force Soldiers to wear substandard equipment , especially equipment that highlights their position to armed opponents . Second point . The camouflage pattern that the Army is looking to adopt over UCP is already employed in Afghanistan by the Army and the Air Force . The money has largely been spent , now it 's just spreading it to the non-deployed Army .
& gt ; Reading the Bible should not make anybody an atheist . The Bible never tries to prove that God exists . It takes God 's existence as true . I dunno . I think there are plenty parts of the Bible that are construed as arguments . Hell , there 's a sense in which any claim that 's made about the world is an argument . And there 's some evidence that ancient texts ( in the Hebrew Bible and elsewhere ) were written to advance a particular theological view ( or even to argue that [ insert phenomenon ] was in fact not a natural event , but a divinely-sanctioned one ) . I mean , nowhere is this sort of `` argumentation '' any clearer than in the epistles of Paul . While in some places he assumes an audience familiar with certain aspects of Judaism , we know that his churches were significantly Gentilic . He would have to totally convince them of the reality of a deity that they did not previously embrace/believe in ( `` Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature , invisible though they are , have been understood and seen through the things he has made '' ) . In Acts , the author has Paul challenging Epicurean and Stoic philosophers , and trying to convince Athenians to embrace the gospel . Further , the gospels themselves are structured and have many motifs that were meant to appeal to Gentiles ( to the extent of downplaying Jesus ' Judaism ) .

A similar study was mentioned in The God Delusion . -- -Religious & amp ; non-religious students were equally likely to cheat , but when the religious ones were put together , they became more likely to cheat after seeing one of their own do it .

I 'm actually confused by the statement that this article makes saying that the `` stand-your-ground law '' had nothing to do with Trayvon Martin 's trial . Although I am aware that the defense did not explicitly claim that Zimmerman 's actions were legal under the stand your ground law , I was under the impression that he did n't have to . My understanding was that because of the law , George Zimmerman 's decision to pursue and confront Martin did not disqualify him from claiming self-defense . I had thought that without the law , Zimmerman 's decision to pursue and confront Martin would have prevented him from using a self-defense claim , because he had decided to put himself into a dangerous situation despite an opportunity to avoid conflict .
Hmmm ... 3 hours , and no liberal response , yet ? Unusual .
This is about how I read it . The author is saying `` [ some argue that if the past is any guide , ] white voters wo n't vote for a black candidate. `` Which was true until Obama . Not that most white voters were necessarily racist , they were just more predisposed to identifying with the white candidate .

I am surprised I am admitting this . When I was 7 , I almost commited suicide . Or at least I mentally tried . I was home with my older brother . He was playing video games or something . I had a large cooking knife ( think chuky ) in my hand , debating stabbing my stomache . My rationale was that because in the mormon religion , until you are baptised at 8 , all sins are forgiven . I kept thinking it was my golden ticket into heaven . I knew suicide was wrong , but I was too young to be held accountable , so yah ! I dont remember why I didnt do it to be honest . I just kept thinking , well , even though my family will be sad , when they get to heaven , we 'll be back together . And killing myself at 7 just seemed like the quickest and surest way there . I guess I chickened out . Now as a very happy atheist , it still sends chills down my spine how close I probably got ... but who knows , I probably would have stopped as soon as the knife scratched me , cause scratches hurt .

This assumes Warren runs , but I 'm not sure she will .

Speculation before the race was that a lot of people who lean Democrat might sit out this election because of a lack of enthusiasm for McAuliffe . Since turnout is never high for these elections , small swings in just how many people care enough to get out to the polls can have a big effect . Paradoxically , when it comes to exit polls , people who describe their party affiliation as none or independent are n't necessarily the least partisan or most informed voters . Cuccinelli 's name dominated the discourse even if most of it was negative . This was basically a race between Cuccinelli and not-Cuccinelli .
The problem comes when the `` personality '' some ascribe to Jesus is utterly , completely counter to everything he taught us . When people who want to worship a schoolyard bully Jesus rant about `` pansies '' they are not simply behaving counter to Jesus ' teachings themselves , they are pretending that Jesus was the exact opposite of what he taught . I 've had people in this subreddit argue that protesting a wedding like a bargain basement Fred Phelps is acting Christlike . You ca n't separate the unloving actions from the hateful personality some want to ascribe to our Lord .

Sorry but this article is .... meh . It 's the same arguments against sola scriptura that have been rehashed over and over again . We would n't know what the NT canon is without the church ! The author also uses the standard `` The Bible says hold to the traditions ! `` There 's no compelling evidence that the Apostles taught or believed in the Assumption of Mary other than Sola Ecclesia ( the church says so ) . This is really sola scriptura vs sola ecclesia .

Too much of the purported `` left '' seems stuck in a tedious oppositionalist rut , rhetorically weaseling for narrow sectarian splinter `` vanguard '' hegemony ... But then , the real left does not call for electoral boycott , here and now , in the US , going into the 21st Century . Nobody 's perfect in every regard . Without going into the substance of purported `` left '' critique of Brand , I have my own analysis as to why is he is very substantially incorrect , despite being somewhat correct , more or less , in his critique of capitalism , and of it 's main claim to fame , `` democracy '' , such as we now know it . While correct in many regards , he is simply , politically , incorrect , to advocate electoral boycott , in my analysis . Those who do so , from a purported `` left '' position tend to believe it 's better for the extreme right to prevail electorally , based on a `` theory '' that the draconian conditions guaranteed to ensue from that will ultimately goad the masses into rising up to overthrow capitalism altogether ... while voting in bourgeois reformists , they say , will only serve to `` lull the masses to sleep '' , thinking `` it 's all good now '' , thus preserving capitalism . This rationale gave us Hitler , Nixon , Reagan and Bush ( s ) ... and 2010 . It has failed to produce revolution , anywhere , but it has indeed ushered in moar draconian rightwing anti-democratic counter-revolutionary policies , ruining the lives of millions of people all over the world , and suppressing revolutionary popular democratic struggle for generations . I also take issue with the premise that `` mere '' bourgeois reforms lull us to sleep , or fool us into thinking capitalism is all better now , heh . Reforms only get our nose open for moar . Give us an inch , and we 'll take a mile . What better arena to press the contradictions of capitalism , and bourgeois `` democracy '' ? A mass electoral uprising , to purge and suppress the right , from now on , would be a good thing , seems to me . Which , of course , is why the right is freaking out , over our first Black Muslim `` Socialist '' Democrat `` fascist '' Prez , heh , who seeks to impose the popular democratic will against the `` freedom '' of racist , sexist , eco-raping rightwing reactionary conservative fundamentalist monopoly corporate fascist murderous ripoff pigs ... who are now the ones calling for civil war , lol . The right recognizes that should a more viable democracy emerge , it will ultimately mean the death of capitalism as we now know it , and of it 's moribund form , fascism . I think they see the writing on the wall more clearly than do much of the purported `` left '' , in this regard . But it 's not over yet . The struggle continues .
This article gives a glimmer of hope , sure , but the reality of the situation is grim . Third party informers ( the ones mentioned in the article are only active in Houston ) can only do so much . My SO works for the state health department and not only do they know NOTHING about how to help people get connected or sign up for the ACA , a federal training program was scheduled for their department but the governor 's office called them the day before the training session and told the department that they were not allowed to attend . Presumably , anyone who attended would be fired . So , the health department does n't have anyone capable of connecting people with the benefits that the ACA offers , nor will there ever be anyone in a state gov position that even knows where to start due to forced lack of training . Make no mistake , there will be no progress ( as the article hopes for ) as long as the governor uses all the power he has to keep the people in a position to help confused and ignorant .

They have no exclusive right to the life , health and wealth of this planet that supersedes yours . Take what you need for your family by any means necessary . The boundaries of social justice and sanity are breaking . The Republican ideology , its religion , its policies are altogether suicide for us as a nation . The last 30 years prove that clearly . Their actions today scream that from rooftops . The younger generation should clue into that and react extremely to what has been going on . Wake up , make noise and start fucking voting in the millions . And right fucking now .

& gt ; Charles and David Koch are both members of the . 00001 % . That ’ s a group of twenty individuals who have a total net worth of over a half-trillion dollars , about $ 26 billion each . I did n't trust a numerical analysis from someone who things that $ 52 billion = over half a trillion dollars , so I checked the numbers . Using the figures from the the excel spreadsheet they link to , they gained $ 12 billion in wealth together ( $ 6 billion each ) . That 's almost $ 32 . 9 million a day , $ 1 . 37 million an hour , $ 22 . 8 thousand an hour , or $ 381 a second . The article says that the food stamps are for $ 1 . 50 a meal , so per year that 's $ 1 . 503365 , or $ 1642 . 5 . Therefore , it would take them 4 . 3 seconds to feed her for the year if they were to split her food stamps bill . This is absolutely shocking by itself . Getting the numbers so wrong totally discredits the criticism , though , and that 's a real pity . ( Note that I 'm not checking the base figures that the article provides , but I 'm not convinced they 're accurate given how careless the author is with the calculations . Also , if I 've made a stupid mistake here , I 'd love to know ! If so , I 'll confess idiocy and apologise unreservedly ! ) Edit : I just saw a txt doc that they linked to that says that he 's basing it on a 50 week working year and 40 hours a week . This does n't make sense to me given that the money gained was an increase in wealth from investments , not salaried income .
Just when you write a paper in college , you have to examine the textual evidence . Penn Jillette had a pretty good review of the evidence and he basically said that the mountain of things that Obama has actually said and the fact that he was a member of that Chicago church for so long has to be weighed against speculation . Sure , he grew up in a secular home , he 's exceptionally bright , and there is plenty of political motivation and coercion that would lead someone to fake religious belief for gain , but unless you are a mind reader , you have to base your evaluation on the textual evidence . I want to believe that Obama is actually an atheist , but the evidence says otherwise .
if you just look at the whole majority of Obama/Dem voters it is either youth voters with not a care in the world except for getting free shit and partying , or adults which tend to have loose morals , have done their fair share of drugs , and live in San Francisco . I personally know a person who voted for his bullshit based solely on the premise of him giving away free birth control . The new age on the rise in this nation is concerned more about the new iphone and kanye west 's baby then their own rights and healthcare . The way this nation is heading no wonder nations like China and India are taking our prosperity and economic growth , the west has become a place where people would rather fork out money to others to get their problems solved , instead of rolling up their sleeves and working , or at least trying . To give you a story , I had a Chinese roommate in school who was attending college here in the US . Now across the hall from us was a room with your normal college students , perhaps even smarter . Now he offered anybody who could do his physics homework $ 20 to complete it , and who took the challenge , yes my Chinese roommate ; who finished it in about 10 minutes . It just goes to show you the mentality shift in this nation , we would rather spend then care , whether that goes for health care , labor , goods , etc . Sorry about the rant , but if you think about the big picture it all ties into each other .
No religious orginization is exactly squeaky clean ... especially when it comes to history .

You joke , but this kind of thing happened before ... in the 1800s . Specifically , mining companies would build towns around their mines .

I thought Mitt would have been a good president for this country at this time . But those predictions were n't all that remarkable . They were more likely inevitable outcomes . The fact that the media mocked him about it was the absolutely incredulous aspect of this . Their bias knows no bounds . They attacked him on his foreign policy tour even though the vast majority of the things he did and commented on were straight up facts or made sense . What we could argue is if Romney 's solutions would have actually averted these problems . At the very least we know he actually had solutions and knew there were problems , Obama had none .
You 're not alone . I consider the Democrats a center-right party , and the GOP fascist religious fucks . I hope we see a progressive party begin to challenge the Dems from the side of reason .

This would n't be an issue if he just cited his sources instead of trying to claim that the ideas are his own . Intellectual dishonestly like this just screams that he ( or whoever does his writing ) is just being lazy .
I 'll speak as the Devil 's advocate here . The area where I live is predominantly Catholic and predominantly Conservative , so I will be speaking to Catholics here . The hate for the ACA is palpable here in the affluent Philly suburbs . Yet when I explain to these Catholics who are also opposed to abortion and gay marriage because of the Church 's teachings that Pope Francis in accordance with years of Catholic social justice teachings stated that healthcare is `` inalienable right '' and a `` moral responsibility '' of the gov't . So , I pose this question to you , how do conservatives go along with the Church 's stance ( assuming you 're Catholic ) that healthcare is an inalienable right and the responsibility of the government and yet still oppose the ACA ? And if you 're not Catholic , surely you realize that Jesus would 've helped out the least in our midst . I also do n't want to imply that religion should be the moral compass for us as Americans . Even if you 're an atheist or agnostic , protecting and providing for those who are less fortunate than us is something that we should be proud to do and actively encourage to ensure a successful society . Disclaimer : Nobody said the ACA was perfect . President Obama has never said that the ACA is perfect . I support delaying it a year to give the government the chance to work out the kinks in the system .
It 's amusing to me when atheist try to convince me that paying taxes is what God meant by helping the poor . If they 're especially ignorant they will say something like `` Remember how Jesus said to Render unto Caesar ... ? ``
This whole thing is embarrassing . I honestly believe the Republican 's thought they had a foolproof gameplan . Some team of consultants and strategists sat around in a room filled with Yes-men and went through all the numbers and tactics that they could think of to use this to make them look like heros . Eventually they all agreed on this brilliant plan , they 'd stage some photos , spin it around as the Dems refusal to work with them , then finally get what they want and look like a party that can get things done . Now it 's just all falling apart in front of them . Sure their Fox News viewers are on their side , but those average American voters are looking at them like they are idiots . Wow . It 's rare to see such a political melt down . I figured the Republican divide was going to happen within the next 10 years , but maybe we 'll get it sooner .
Not sure why people are all up in arms about the title . Religious references almost always over shadow anything else that surround it . That , and if you actually read the very short article , it 's clear the whole Biblical method of rearing the child was the focus . I think the homeschooling tid bit is just there to show how controlling these parents were at all times , and why the child never had a chance to get help from a typical source , like a teacher . None of this has a negative stigma to homeschooling in general .
Feinstein is a complete tool , any `` reforms '' from her are likely utter rubbish .
Do n't forget the Democrat 's internal memos where they revealed their true justification for blocking Estrada : his ethnicity . As a hispanic conservative , he was on the fast track to the Supreme Court , and they could n't let the Republicans be the first to appoint a Hispanic judge . Completely immoral , but I guess that 's to be expected of the Democrats at this point .
A sad day in conservative circles ; he made our job so easy . You do n't have to prepare a cogent argument when this moron is presenting the other side .
How is he going to `` cut off our healthcare ? `` He could cut off the exchanges and make it slightly harder for us to find insurance . But there is no such thing as federal health insurance . The public option does not exist . That was the basically one-sided compromise that Democrats that netted them zero extra support from Republicans . But if I buy my insurance from a private company through the exchange , how exactly is Obama going to take that away from me ?
I assume it 's because the secret service still uses some of the same tactics for securing a location .

Aah , the 'othering ' process in action . I think there are quite a few terms in the article that require definition- 'Bible-believing ' for example . The word 'Christian ' covers a massively diverse array of people across centuries and continents . It seems as though what the writer is getting at is the idea of cultural or nominal Christianity . I 'm not sure why we need a new word for it , if anything it 's unhelpful in terms of dialogue . Also , everyone reinterprets the bible in a way that suits their culture , whether they 're aware of it or not . There is no such thing as a pure , timeless , culturally untainted Bible believing Christian- is n't that why we need grace ? I 'm reliant on God for my salvation , not the perfection of my doctrine ?
The only thing i see wrong is the fact that the Kansas City Rescue Mission pretty much waited until the last minute to tell them they can not volunteer . That is a pretty crappy thing to do , if they knew a month ago when they asked then they could have organized something themselves . other then that it is perfectly understandable why they do not think that the atheists volunteers would be a good fit . As a an atheist I would also have an issue handing out food stuffed with religious pamphlets .

I 'm kind of confused by his post . `` And while my healthcare . gov application has been stuck for a month now at the “ View Eligibility Results ” stage '' In other words , he has no insurance . He says he can pick up the phone , etc , but he has n't done so yet . He 's assuming he can still apply and that there will be no problems there as well . Perhaps he should finish enrolling first before he says how great it is to be covered ?
Would you be having this problem if it were a conservative pres ?

The amazing fact is that fans of right wing radio , tv , etc . , who are mostly upper middle class , actually believe that the `` rich '' Do create jobs and wealth for the middle class . These suckers only need to pull out a 5-10 year old paystub , and the one from last week to see the proof . Cost of living has gone up 30-55 % for the average middle class family , depending on where you live -- -- -- and they still do n't get it . Goebbels said if you tell a lie consistently , it becomes truth . Good article . I 've been saying this for years . It is in the 1 % best interest to share the wealth , but 99 % of them do n't . Oh well .

Hitler was not an atheist . Stalin and Mao I 'll give you . But not Hitler . Hitler was raised Christian and retained most of his Christian beliefs throughout his life . He also happened to be batshit crazy so I 'm not even going to say that his Christianity caused or facilitated his atrocities . But he was not an atheist . I will not budge on that .
And also , do people forget Bush already ? I know he had some terrible progressive policies in office but before he ran , he was definitely viewed as a strong conservative . He had that Texas mentality , southern draw , supported low taxes , strong on defense , etc . Even with the media constantly attacking him , he still won reelection . And do n't forget Reagan . Go look up his 2nd presidential numbers and see how many electoral votes he got . You 'll think its a typo .

There needs to be a baseline for those surveyed . I 'm sure the bulk of the 41 % are individuals that pay little to no attention to domestic affairs and policies . Asking if they approve of Obama 's handling of the health policy is the same as asking them if they like Obama .
I am still trying to figure out the goal with this ad . Is it to persuade women to `` get between the covers '' with more strange men ? Is it to get men to see women as more wanting of casual encounters ? The `` got insurance '' seems secondary to the sexual motivations it points to .

Cool , we can keep the governorship and take her congressional seat !
There are already a number of alternatives called `` Alt-coins '' . There are usually based off of bitcoin itself with different tweaks . If those tweaks make them better then bitcoin , they could become worth more . However , currently bitcoin has a huge lead in terms of the network effect , meaning lots of people are involved in mining , owning and using bitcoin . They already have software and infrastructure in place to work with bitcoins , so it would take some effort for them to move to a different crypto currency . It could happen , but there would need to be a very good reason .

I have long been a supporter of voting for moderates because , well , the democrat option would have been worse . I 'll vote for the lesser of 2 evils . And I have been burned every single time . Too long have I ignored principle in favor of `` winning elections. `` And the mindset that , `` it 's all about winning elections , '' is why politicians are such shitty people . My vote is no longer given out to people with an R after their name . From now on , it must be earned . If that means losing elections , so be it . But if you ever want the republican party to get its act together , we need to throw out the progressives .
They also view it as a one way street and decry the `` war on Christmas '' so you know its also bullying christians to disagree with them too .
Crap . FICA is more than SS payouts , so even if FICA goes straight into T-bills , the T-bills are then used to finance government operations . Yes , the government is running a deficit , but SS is not part of the deficit , it is financing the deficit . The cure for deficit spending is taxation , plain and simple , not screwing the people with nothing left to lose .
The problem is that Republican messaging on health care is easy for Americans to digest : `` just do n't reform it '' . The PPACA is a major improvement that was sorely needed as a starting point for universal coverage but things like `` we need to get rid of your garbage sham insurance so you can get better and cheaper options '' are too complicated to message . This country 's voters only want to be told what they want to hear , and they want to hear messages that are n't longer than a sound bite . So long as this is true , conservatives running on a platform of `` keep things the way they are '' will have an advantage .
I am anti-Catholicism and Protestant , but that does not mean that I am anti-Catholicism because I am Protestant .
Done .
Ten years later and we are still at war and no safer than when we started . The NSA 's unprecedented overreach of authority was born of this administration . It does n't matter if he thought he was doing right at the time , he was wrong and we continue to pay the price for that .
along the with the trend of universities doing outrageous things : I had to take a sexual harassment class for like 20 mins before the year . Everyone takes them and they 're a complete waste of time . Everyone purposefully answers them incorrectly just to fuck with them . But one question that really was messed up was this : `` If there is an accusation of sexual assault , the standard is that the person accused is A . ) more than likely guilty B . ) not likely to be guilty C. ) innocent until proven guilty . The correct answer was A ! ! Are you fucking kidding me ? ! In college , you are not innocent until proven guilty ; you are most likely guilty until proven innocent . What the hell ? ! I wrote to them and ripped them a new one and they had nothing . They tried to argue that `` most likely guilty , '' did not imply guilty until proven innocent . Umm what ? ! If I was in a jury and before hearing anything from a case , I said , `` yeah , he 's probably guilty , '' How in the fuck is that not implying guilt until proven innocent . Apparently , there 's a law that the standard for these incidents is such .
The Holy Bible has never condoned homosexual marriage . It clearly states it in several scriptures . If homosexuality was something that was okay with God , would n't there have been some essential archetype on which we would be able to base pro-homosexuality beliefs ? God made a man and a woman . Adam and Eve , not Adam and Steve . Would not God have given us an example where homosexuality was okay ? The only love between people of the same sex can righteously be seen through Philadelphians love . Brotherly/sisterly love between two people of the same sex is okay , much like Jonathan and King David . I hope this has cleared up some things for Christians who are unsure of which belief to side with . Below is scripture from the Bible to support my beliefs . Leviticus 18:22 - Thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it [ is ] abomination . Leviticus 20:13 - If a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood [ shall be ] upon them . Romans 1:24-27 - Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts , to dishonour their own bodies between themselves : Matthew 19:4-6 - And he answered and said unto them , Have ye not read , that he which made [ them ] at the beginning made them male and female , Now of course , I believe homosexuality is a sin people struggle with , but I am writing this to clarify that yes , I love gay people just as much as thieves , liars , adulterers , etc . The Bible demands that we as Christians are still to love them the same , and for anyone who believes that we are not , you obviously do not read the Bible , where it says to love everybody . That being said God bless you all and have a fantastic day .

Because that thing 'Justice ' that you were taught about by adults as a kid ? It falls in the same category as 'Santa Claus ' . Adults go though a lot of trouble to make children ( and sometimes themselves ) believe it is real , but really it is just some made up thing we pretend is happening .

If marijuana was legalized , would it be a safe assumption that most businesses that drug test would stop doing so ? ( As far as pot is concerned ) Do they drug test because marijuana is against the law , or just because the business owners do n't want an employee that gets high ? What about the governments strict zero tolerance policy ?

& gt ; 93 million eligible citizens did not vote Republicans won about half the electorate 's vote . So it 's really only about 25 % of citizens who voted for them . And the extreme wing of the Republican party is about 1/3 of their caucus , so maybe 10 % of Americans voted for the Tea Party .

Correct me if I 'm wrong , but is n't Obamacare one of the govt services that would be exempt from de-funding ? So it 'd be a moot point for them .
& gt ; It is not our place to say what someone can and can not do No , that 's God 's place , and even He allows us free will , and gives us rules to guide us towards him . As Christians , we are called to call others to repent and salvation based on God 's standards and Jesus ' redemption .
I heard someone let something leak where they found out that all the democratic senators INCLUDING Warren signed a note encouraging Hillary to run for president . That would be a strange note to sign if you planned on running against her . That rumor aside , as much as I like Warren , I still think she 's too inexperienced . Clinton would have arguably more well rounded and applicable experience than any presidential nominee to ever run for President : First Lady , Senator , AND Secretary of State . Her track record at each of those positions is pretty stellar . PLUS , looking at the electoral map , she has the best chance of any nominee that I can think of Democratic or Republican due to the fact she could realistically carry Arkansas AND against Governor Christie , I read somewhere she is polling 4 points AHEAD in New Jersey . Show me a realistic electoral map where a Republican nominee can win without Arkansas . Warren will have her time , but I think she should use these 4 years in the Senate and whatever other public office she can hold during hopefully Clinton 's 8 years in office before considering a run of her own . By that time she 'll have the experience and political wherewithal to actually be effective and win . Do n't forget that WINNING is a huge part of the equation .

I wish Bill would get some consistency . A month ago he had a segment where he literally whined about how horrible his tax rate in California was , and threatened the governor that rich people like him would just move . Now this .

I agree ! Politicians should not be reading jokes or email chains aloud to staff on business time ! !
Honestly , I think there is another reason . Arrogance . Obama believes that he 's above all this and it 's just petty political games that the Republicans are playing . Remember , these are the people who think that Clinton 's impeachment was about a blowjob . There is no end to their self delusion .

Last I checked my Bible , a Jewish mob led by the Jewish priests of the time dragged Jesus to the Roman Prefect , Pontius Pilate , and basically told him to either execute the man as a traitor or they 'd riot and destroy his career . Pilate tried to reason with the mob and find a way out , but ultimately decided a miscarriage of justice was preferable to having the city torn apart with Jesus probably just being lynched anyways . So , it looks like Jesus was killed by a mob of 1st century Jews . How is that controversial ?
More states should create a state board similar to what California has to draw district lines and create a better functioning democracy . We need districts that are able to swing both ways so reps are n't beholden to just their party .
& gt ; Here was a great opportunity for Jesus to speak profound wisdom to a man who seemed , at times , to genuinely want it . Why didn ’ t Jesus tell him ? Because Jesus was only as wise as the people writing the story . And the answers to philosophical questions are n't half as important as the questions themselves .
& gt ; Vermont also has yet to answer how it will cover everyone . Vermonter here . Good luck to us in maintaining the necessary levels of tax revenue to effectively fund a model single payer system when we have the oldest population in the U. S. ( and growing in numbers ) coinciding with watching our 20 and 30 somethings leave Vermont to pursue job opportunities and business opportunities out of state . It 's unsustainable when our younger people are leaving the state to expect those few who do stay to support those who need healthcare the most . Without a younger workforce attracted by a diverse and strong in-state business climate to warrant their residence , who will to shoulder the tax burden for those who use healthcare the most ? I 'm curious to learn if the law and program will be challenged under the equal protection clause since the benefit of single payer protection may not extend to those who pay into the system but are not offered single payer benefits due to being offered health insurance through their employer . The Governor and the Vermont Assembly need to take a long hard look at our state 's constitution before assuming powers not expressed . If state lawmakers want the power to provide residents with a state based healthcare solution , lawmakers must ask us Vermonters for this power by referendum and amend the state constitution upon our consent .
This is my fucking senator ... I HATE that man ...
As a member of the intelligent moderate majority ... and we ARE the majority ... I agree .
He can pretty much claim whatever he wants about this `` blessing '' since God is on & amp ; not on his side ... It 's far too easy for con artists to scam people and live extravagantly using the Bible to justify their actions . Wealth is a sign of righteousness . Psalm 37:25 I have been young , and [ now ] am old ; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken , nor his seed begging bread . Psalm 112:1 Praise ye the LORD . Blessed [ is ] the man [ that ] feareth the LORD , [ that ] delighteth greatly in his commandments . Proverbs 13:22 A good [ man ] leaveth an inheritance to his children 's children : and the wealth of the sinner [ is ] laid up for the just . Proverbs 15:6 In the house of the righteous [ is ] much treasure : but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble . Wealth is a sign of wickedness . Matthew 19:23-24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples , Verily I say unto you , That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven . And again I say unto you , It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God . Luke 6:24 But woe unto you that are rich ! for ye have received your consolation . James 5:1 Go to now , [ ye ] rich men , weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon [ you ] . He sounds like he 's running a business more than a ministry . Via /r/politics He donates the books to the church and allows them to sell them for profit . This essentially creates a nice little tax write-off for him . It also blurs the lines between `` profit from the book '' and money from the church . Essentially , he is treating your church as a nice little tax-haven . His salary is set by 4 other Mega-Church Pastors . They also pay an undisclosed amount of money to each other for visiting each other 's churches . It 's a `` you scratch my back I 'll scratch yours '' situation . They also refuse to reveal said salaries . Essentially , this is a very creative and business-like approach for him and the other Mega-Church pastors to make millions while denying any responsibility in said salary . It is no different than 5 CEOs setting pay for each other . They bring in over $ 20 million annually . Barely over $ 2 million goes to the community . A lot of it goes to production and improvements , however , unlike nearly every other Southern Baptist church , the pastor 's pay remains a secret . From my understanding these Mega-Churches are an exemption from all other Southern Baptist bylaws , however , there is absolutely no reason to keep these salaries a secret unless there is a fear of public ridicule or shame . All employees are also required to sign a nondisclosure form and are threatened with a lawsuit if they reveal church financials .
I have Comcast , and it states in the agreement that you ca n't host servers , unless you upgrade to business class . I assume most ISPs have similar agreements .

said Manhattan Republican Party Chairman Dan Isaacs .. `` we were victims of our success . It 's hard to impart to people that the gains we 've made could be lost very quickly '' And this is the fear mongering of the right wing . Nothing much is going to change . Maybe the top 10 % will pay a tiny bit more in taxes and maybe the bottom 50 % will catch a break here or there . The real estate interests will still run the place . Muzzio said the challenge now is maintaining the progress logged under Bloomberg while making the city more inclusive .

`` Why ca n't you just leave religion alone ? `` Shit like this is fucking why .
The question was extra much not `` how do we make sure artists are paid '' , since the big copyright conglomerations do n't give a crap about that . They are all about themselves getting paid . The artists generally should consider themselves lucky if they get the equivalent of minimum wage , especially if they are musicians . Before this : salon . com/2000/06/14/love 7/ I had little respect for Courtney Love , but after that I have a little more . Anyway , the way to ensure art is made and is available is very simple , decouple all humans now living from the need to `` earn a living '' . Convert to a moneyless , classless , nationless word built on cooperation and resource sharing and far more artists than now will have the time and resources to focus on their craft instead of flipping burgers 10 hours a day to make ends meet . See , and .

Plenty of economists would agree : & gt ; A similar survey in 2006 by Robert Whaples polled PhD members of the American Economic Association . Whaples found that 37 . 7 % of respondents supported an increase in the minimum wage , 14 . 3 % wanted it kept at the current level , 1 . 3 % wanted it decreased , and 46 . 8 % wanted it completely eliminated . People have to realize that this is something even economists are unsure of . It 's not so clear cut .
Chris Rock had a joke about that ; he said that when he tells the kids it 's time for bed they race around for ten minutes saying they want to stay up ; then they fall asleep on the floor . The GOPs have been super-crazy since Obama got elected , maybe now they are finally getting tired .
Indeed , we 'll have to wait till that video sees the light of day . If ever .
I usually do n't like listening to Limbaugh , but every now and then he articulates a point so perfectly . This is one of those times .
The Republicans got what they wanted because the Democrats wanted it too . The Democrats of Congress are , as a whole , not a progressive bunch . If we want something better , we need a different congress and a different funding model .
Took me awhile , but I see what you did there .
I wonder what metrics he 's using ( the article does n't seem to mention them ) . If I had to guess , the numbers of strong conservatives probably have n't increased , but their activity has , and is having an effect on the middle 40 % of the country .
How do we have `` restore the economy '' and `` blow up the finance sector '' in the same headline ?
If the republicans would take note that they have chased away the Libertarians with candidates like Cuccinelli , they could easily win . The country is n't going more left . Just look at the statistics . The country has a growing classically liberal/libertarian wing , and we are coming from the right . I 'm only in this forum out of curiosity , and for the sake of discussion .
Honestly , this is the biggest headline of the evening - I 'm surprised it 's taken this long to be written up : - Tea-party funded candidate in VA loses to doofus of a Democrat ( I can say that , I 'm in VA , and I voted for the doofus ) - Moderate Republican governor in NJ ... whom the Tea-party hates and ... wins re-election by notable margin - Democrat wins mayorship of NYC , having run on a platform of increasing taxes on the wealthy - Some Alabama tea-party rep by a fellow Republican who is ( presumably , hopefully ) a bit more sane ...
That is the same 25 % of the GOP population that votes in Republican primaries and continues to move the party farther and farther from reality . There are too many angry , old , out of touch white people that refuse to accept they are a part of the problem and insist everyone else is the problem . Their logic allows for such gems as : Cut government spending but increase funding to the local military base because I 'm scared of nearly non existent terrorism on American soil . Cut the debt but lower taxes . Keep your government hands off my Medicare and do n't give it to those^ people ^ Includes anyone that does not look or think exactly as I do .
& gt ; I have been reading a lot of articles about Blackstone . Just because they have deep pockets , does n't mean they know what they are doing . LTCM anyone ? & gt ; The idea of buying up individual properties is just ridiculous . They ca n't maintain those properties properly . Each house has its own set of unique issues , because they were built with the idea an individual would buy and live the house and maintain it themselves . I would n't say it IS N'T doable . Because it certainly IS . But only if they are building out a SOLID , RELIABLE system of property management to take care of all of the issues . Instead , they seem to be focused on repackaging and selling this shit -- reaping the short term profits -- and leaving others as the bag holders . IMO this is potentially even worse than the traditional `` slumlord '' model .

Jillette 's video has so many more views because he is much , much more famous than the other two . Interesting article but the opening saying that it has more views because it hits a nerve is space that could have been used better .
People seem to be downplaying the importance of YouTube to Google . It 's their avenue for movie sales from the Play store , it 's a source of revenue for a LOT of people who make videos for channels , it 's their future avenue for all things video and it 's the biggest video site on the internet . While it ca n't be denied this is a push to increase Google+ use , more importantly it 's a push to get rid of the horrible shit said in video comments . If you want to comment , make an account . If you do n't want to make an account , try to live without adding to the discussion . It 's meant to curb trolling , not bend your arm backwards and reach for your precious data .

What 's really haunting is the phrase `` adopted daughter '' . I ca n't help but think of whatever unfortunate circumstances took place that ended up with Hana needing to be adopted and the sort of trust that children inherently have in their guardians . In another article , they mention that Hana was 13 and adopted from Ethiopia . She crossed oceans and continents expecting a life better than the one she was leaving behind . I ca n't even fathom the confusion and betrayal she felt as the people who saved her from one sort of hell would be the ones she that would need saving from .
Agreed , reading the bible by itself does n't do anything to make someone an atheist . It 's taken as fact in the Bible that God exists . One could definitely judge God 's character to be less than omnibenevolent or the way he does things to be less than omnipotent in our eyes , but those issues do n't have any bearing on whether he exists or not .
The difference is that Reagan actually had some fucking accomplishments . He was able to pull us out of the Carter recession and helped accelerate the end of the Cold War .
& gt ; Stimson tracks liberal policy mood , but I have reversed his index in order to highlight the striking current level of conservatism . So it 's not more conservative , it 's less liberal . That makes quite a difference .
Yeah , she just confirmed it .
Obama was supporting known terrorist organizations and spent two weeks lying about the nature of a terrorist attack . Even after it was known the Administration was lying they continued with the lie until they could n't any more . Why Obama has n't been impeached over Benghazi , or a multitude of other equally serious scandals , is beyond me .
This from the people who scream that Obama has taken their `` freedoms '' away
Well , both parties are guilty of gerrymandering . Understand that gerrymandering is legal if it upholds the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment ( 1 ) . While race can not be the predominant factor in creating electoral districts ( 2 ) , gerrymandering has been defended under the argument that it provides minorities with greater sociological representation . This is an argument often made by both sides ( 3 ) . Sources : 1 ) wikipedia . org/wiki/Baker v. Carr 2 ) wikipedia . org/wiki/Miller v. Johnson 3 ) David Lublin , `` The Paradox of Representation : Racial Gerrymandering and Minority Interests in Congress '' TLDR ; The practice is used and justified by both sides as a social equalizer , despite not actually serving as one .
MLK would be probably be ashamed of what happened to this country . The Boondocks did a pretty great satire exploring that point . The problem is , people who advocate for civil rights are not advocating for all of them , just for themselves , or whoever they are guilted into advocating for . Everyone always assumes that the civil rights only worth fighting for include : women LGBT illegal immigrants blacks But neglect things like : gun ownership right to privacy freedom of religion ( across the board , from catholics to muslims to norse , and everything in between ) As if they forget that those are civil rights as well , and are being tarnished/diminished .
This is going to piss off reddit . /r/AdviceAnimals is already drawing up a protest meme as we speak .
Note it says China RAISED not China PROCESSED . More food safety concerns are at the processing side of the equation rather than at the farm . The USDA has repeatedly found that China 's food safety protocols at their processing plants are not up to par with US standards and therefore continue to ban imports of meat that was butchered in China . Somewhat misleading title . EDIT :
Exactly . I 'm a right leaning independent and I really ca n't stand either party , but at this particular time in history , one is batshit insane , on the wrong side of just about every major issue , not to mention some pretty significant social and demographic trends , and has lost all interest in governing . There is nothing left of the 90 's GOP type candidates that I used to support .
I think the article made it pretty clear that the influence she holds in the senate could have a far greater influence on policy than what she or anyone could do as president . The senate as a whole absolutely holds more power than the president and therefore senators who can influence the entire body ( or at least a majority ) hold a unique power in the government . Not to mention that her strengths are specifically as a consumer advocate who is tough on Wall Street and banks . Does that translate to being a great president ? Not necessarily . Does it translate to being a great senator ? Absolutely , because you are allowed to focus on a narrower range of interests . And lastly , while she has great appeal to liberals and progressives , she does n't exactly have that same appeal all over the country . Middle of the road voters , the type you need to win presidential elections , still fear the picture that the right is able to pair of people like her . To be clear : they do n't fear her unfiltered policy ideas , they fear the politician that the right would portray her as . So yes , I resoundingly approve of her politics and would rather she stay in the senate . And I am very sane .
In the words of Jason Jones : `` THIS IS NOT A FUCKING GAME ''
About . Fucking . Time .
1 is meaningless words around a false dichotomy . 2 is an attempt to repackage Pascal 's Wager . I 'm certain Pascal came before CS Lewis . 3 is more meaningless words . The kind that can mean anything depending on the reader and therefore really hold no meaning ( something that can mean anything is ultimately meaningless ) . 4 echoes words that have been said for probably as long as we 've had words to say , certainly best summed up by Shakespeare - T'is better to have loved and lost ... There is nothing `` ahead of it 's time '' about that . 5 amounts to `` actions speak louder than words '' . Any form of this statement is not new or ahead of it 's time . 6 is wishful thinking . Also not a new concept which should be patently obvious in this sub given the majority here hold to a belief started some 2000ish years ago that the things in your future will be better than the past behind you . I do n't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity . 7 is a repackaging of the concept of suffering for God . Once again , I do n't think CS Lewis pre-dates Christianity . 8 is a statement that would hold true no matter when it was said . In that way it was of it 's time when he first said it , not ahead of it 's time . 9 is probably the only example of a thought from CS Lewis ( in this list ) that is ahead of it 's time . Though I genuinely doubt it is a thought that was n't expressed or taught or followed by some congregations somewhere in the world throughout the history of the church . 10 basically says `` heaven is good '' . That 's not a thought ahead of it 's time . Once again , CS Lewis does not pre-date Christianity . Less of a list of quotes that show he was ahead of his time . More of a lot of repetition of previous philosophers/theologians , a collection of meaningless phrases , and a single progressive thought .
I hate it when they do n't give out number . 400x of what ? 400 times of almost nothing is still pretty much useless nothing . nifty phenomenon , but still useless nothing .

I do n't know , but I 've known a lot of very liberal people who joined the military , or began taking economics classes in college , and then became very conservative . I guess they teach them that ?
If you 're in England , there 's a pretty big celebration ( which costs money , alas ) celebrating women in STEM fields . Here 's an about the event and the day . Help promote women in science ! Promote feminine kinds of big picture thinking so that not just tom-boys like me end up doing science . : - )
In many states , the cities and urban areas report first , followed by the rural areas . For some reason , Virginia is the other way , and the deeply red rural areas always report first . Romney was way ahead early election night 2012 even when the count passed 50 percent , but eventually lost as the night went on .
I get the distinct impression that Jeremy Paxman completely agrees with him . This is Paxman trying to give him a stage to stand on .
The policy on Cuba is probably the most antiquated we have . The Cold War is over yet we continue those policies on that country and that country only . How many Americans have they kidnapped or killed in the last 30 years ? Yet we continue to do business with Saudi Arabia , a country which produced most of the hijackers for 9/11 . What if those 19 Saudi hijackers were Cuban extremists ? Sanctions would be tightened regardless and maybe even another invasion would have been considered . It 's so ridiculously antiquated it would be hard to take seriously if it were n't for the real human cost our embargo causes .
Honest question yahoo `` news '' . Why is the fact this lady is a member of the Tea Party important ? I feel like local school district politics is a completely different ballgame where people of wide varying ideologies can come together to push forward a common agenda . I 'm sure there 's plenty of democrats , republicans , libertarians , independents , etc who are also planning to vote against this bond for their own reason also .
I 've had my own issues with youth group , but I think this article is overreaching . & gt ; '' The inherent result of youth groups is that teenagers in the church are focused on their peers , not their parents or their pastors . It 's a foreign sociology that leads to immaturity , a greater likelihood of sexual activity , drug experimentation and a rejection of the authority of the Word of God . Seriously ? What kind of youth groups is he talking about , and in those youth groups , are the adults actually any different ? And I thought this juxtaposition was interesting : & gt ; '' Our fervent prayer is that God will raise up Spirit-filled , Bible-preaching , Christ-centered , family-integrated assemblies from the ashes of our man-centered , family-fragmenting churches , '' with & gt ; '' It 's time for the Christian father to take the central role which God has ordained , '' McManus concludes . `` Gathered around the dining room table , the father needs to lead family worship once again , which had been standard behavior for a vibrant American Christian family for hundreds of years , dating back to the Plymouth , Mass . , colony of 1620 . Dad needs to read from and discuss the Bible , sing Christian songs and pray with his family , his little flock over which God has appointed him shepherd . I mean , I get what it 's saying , but the last paragraph sounds pretty `` man-centered '' to me .
Non-denominational . The church is certainly not a building , but the people .
My mother-in-law watches way to much cable TV , and loves MSNBC and any documentary that talks about how we are raping the plant , bombing brown people , etc . I have been telling her for years that this whole thing was going to fall apart , and it is a big fat lie . She must have zero memory because she told me on Sunday , `` I called and the plan is no help at all , I will have to pay a lot of money , and have a $ 6K deductible ! I have been lied to ! `` The thing is it is hard to enjoy the disappointment of the died in the wool liberals as it is damaging our country .

Who with half a brain watches NBC ? Thanks for telling me otherwise I would n't have known .
She seems to make a point of knowing nothing about anything . For example the assault weapons ban is one of her big things and yet she seems to lack even a cursory knowledge about guns . I just do n't get how someone whose job affects the entire country ca n't talk to an expert or read a fucking wikipedia article every once in a while .
It 's a trap !
Scumbags like that wannabe pastor is why people do n't wan na trust God and His promises to take care of us . I am constantly making mistakes , so I 'm not at all saying I 'm better than him . However , I hope God either changes that louse or takes away his leadership position before he hurts anyone else !
& gt ; `` Minimum wage is n't supposed to be livable. `` you know , i 'd be fine arguing this one , IF we were n't in the current economic situation we 're in . minimum wage jobs were supposed to be for kids working their first jobs , part time , to get some entry-level work experience under their belt . everyone 's got to start someplace , right ? or they 're for moms of school-age kids who need extra spending money and a flexible schedule of 9am - 3pm . or they 're for retirees who have investment income but want to get out of the house and just need something with low responsibility but high social interaction . once you got a few years ( and a few 25¢ raises ) under your belt , you went on to better pay and better skill jobs , either during or after college . the problem now is that those better skill jobs have n't opened back up since 2008/2009 . so the only jobs that are available are the ones that are $ 9 an hour or less ... technically above minimum wage , but not liveable , and certainly not ones that demand the skills college grads and mid-20 's ( or older ) already possess . so if the only jobs that companies are willing to hire for are the low-skill minimum wage positions , without much hope of raises or even promotions ( since a lot of companies have severed the wage increase from the title promotion ) , then those jobs damn well better pay enough that a single person can support themselves without having to rely on anyone else . if you work a second job in order to save up money to better your situation , great . if you get a roommate in order to save up money to better your situation , great . if you do either ( or both ) of those things because nobody is willing to pay enough to let you pay the rent AND eat ? no so great .
I think healthcare for-profit is a perverse way of doing things . Socialized medicine might not be superior , but for-profit medicine is just ugly . Why treat the poor when there 's no profit in that ? Just like telecoms leave rural areas in poor connectivity - no profit in wiring up the countryside .
The more important question here is should the government be allowed to issue secret rulings and legal precedents .
Do n't blame religion . The kid had issues and probably would have found a reason to do it anyway .
Or . Just anything less ambiguous than Stephen Hawking .

Whether or not you agree that what they 're doing is necessary or good , you 've got to admire their willingness to stick to what they think is important .
This makes my brain hurt . I have absolutely no problem with going to a bar , even having a small group or prayer service there , but having a Eucharistic service and your main services there ? No , just no . It 's like in Christianity today reverence has become something evil and negative to be avoided at all costs . And how does anyone think this will work ? When we show we think so little of the holy things that we do them in bars while getting shitfaced , that 's supposed to impress the people there and seriously draw them to conversion ? I think if I was a random guy on a bar I 'd conclude that any belief system whose members regarded it so cavalierly was n't worth my time .
And people are crying in /r/conservative because a misleading article is being downvoted . Ok .
I just want to thank you for taking a stand on Christian principles . Its disgusting that even on a supposedly Christian forum you 're getting flack from other Christians for taking a stand on clear scriptural truths .
I will always maintain that giving these people so much money is insane . Make them send their kids to public school and see how fast our education system would improve . Make them take the same public transportation as the rest of us and see how quickly things improve . You ca n't serve a public you are so detached from on a basic day to day level .
Exactly this . If I have to wait a year , it 'll be spoiled . I want to watch things without spoilers when they come out . Also , my friends are all over the world . We pirate because we want to chat about the latest episode of something like friends do .

This is one of my favorite all time quotes ever . And I 'm a Christian .
42 % with the Tea Party ? ! I did not think it was that high .
So Obama 's failure is that he did n't get the right progressive in congress to pass the right laws ? That 's a pretty poor argument for the extent of presidential power ...
Now I really want to know why no one sent any military support . To not send additional security when it was asked for prior to the attack could be brushed off as an oversight ( although I do n't think it should be ) , but to not send help while a coordinated attack was undeniably underway makes no sense to me . And I ca n't help but think that decision was politically motivated .
in one hand i carry fire , in the other , water . with the water , i will quench the fires of hell , with the fire , i will burn down heaven . i do these things so that no man will seek heaven for the glory of god , or the fear of hell . or something like that ...
Almost all if not all of the states tied to that rule STILL have the same issues they had 50 years ago ... Which is why all of those states immediately went ahead to vote in more voting restrictions the second it was removed .
Serious question : What does that make us ? Because it kind of feels like being hostages . Not specifically to extremist political factions , but to a broken and corrupt system that allows extremism to dictate the future . After all the shouting back and forth between Team Red and Team Blue , we 're all going to look up and realize that there are guards at the door , bars on the window , and cameras on the walls .
& gt ; One example is a patient suffering from sleep apnea-like symptoms . Years earlier , this patient had a blood gas test that would have confirmed the diagnosis , but the test results were hidden in a hard-to-find section of the medical record . Without Watson , Mehta says he never would have seen the result . & gt ; & gt ; `` The system looks for competing theories that might explain the patient 's symptoms '' & gt ; & gt ; The process for finding that crucial test turns out to be remarkably similar to finding the right answer to a Jeopardy question . Having built a basic concept map from studying medical exams , Watson parses the medical records for facts and test results , then knits them together into competing theories that might explain the patient 's symptoms . Mike Barborak , a natural language engineer at IBM Research , describes it as a step towards a more intelligent kind of machine . `` It 's language processing but it 's also using this notion of combining those different salient factors to see if one supports or contradicts the other and coming up with some conclusion of what 's actually being stated , '' Barborak says . That means looking beyond the words of the diagnosis for a basic sense of how the words fit together , and what each possible diagnosis means . For anyone interested : org/ & gt ; Natural Language Toolkit is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data .

It 's open source software , and the book to learn it is free . & gt ; The total amount of medical information available doubles every five years . Worse , medical knowledge tends to go stale within four to eight years . Meanwhile , free time is a commodity most physician ’ s have precious little of—five hours a month at most .

I think it 's a bit presumptuous to assume that getting rid of one of our two parties will lead to anything good . Please recall that a new party or parties is no more likely an option than just having one party .
I 'm from Texas . I normally vote libertarian , but I think I 'll cite for her this time just to get the GOP out of office . Rick Perry is a pile of shit .
Why would you name your kid Messiah in the first place ?

You should do a post on your past experiences on navigating without health insurance and then your experiences on the ACA process you 've so far encountered .
Remember when the same people who are now banning WE THE PEOPLE from public property and land were telling us the 'occupiers ' had every right to be there ?
If you look at some of the quotes from the groups ( certainly the ones I 've read from the AFA and FRC ) , no Christian should be saying those things . They are untrue and malicious , never mind downright paranoid and xenophobic .
This blog seems to be describing what Anglicanism largely is already . Catholic and Reformed .

I sometimes listen to Beck . I subscribe to the Blaze . For the most part I like him , but this statement or lack of action is just stupid . If it 's Christie Vs. Clinton 2016 , I am voting for Christie . Primaries may be a different story . It is up to conservatives to put someone we like in the race , not Christie or anyone else .
This favors aetheists so its religious discrimination either way
Did he ever threaten it though ? IIRC he basically never seriously indicated that he would do it , so this gives me hope .
There 's nobody to sue . The entity that is guilty of wage theft is the temp agency , some fly-by-night whose only assets are a couple of telephones and maybe a desk . Laws could be written to allow the real employer to get hit for theft of wages ... but they have n't been .
If you 're not Catholic it 's unlikely you care what the Pope says .
If Warren runs , I will caucus and volunteer for her , if it 's Hillary , I will vote for her , but only because she wont be as bad as whoever the Republican 's run , but that 's about it . I 'm so fucking sick of the establishment Democratic candidate , I thought I was campaigning against it with Obama , turns out he was just another one .
Yes . /SAtoSQ
Considering homophobia in general is on its way out , I imagine a trend will come from this . Not to suggest that popularity makes truth , but when society accepts our LGBT brothers and sisters as equal , it 's going to be as hard to get members for a church that preaches otherwise as it is to get members for a segregationist church is today .
Straightforward ! Thank you for sharing
I 'm not sure how I feel about his theology but I would n't take how many feathers he ruffles too seriously until you at least look deeper than I have into what he says and how he justifies it .

Educationists ...
I live in a small town which thrives on its tourism industry . All the business owners around here learned from the recession is how few employees their businesses can function on . Now that the economy is bouncing back they are n't hiring employees to make up for the difference , instead they just drive their skeleton crews into the ground and burn people out . When someone quits they know there are hundreds of other people who are desperate for a job through the winter . It 's really , really fucked up .
The poll is not as indicative of the public 's view on his policies as much as we 'd like to think . When viewed in the context of congress ' low approval ratings ( 10 percent ? ) this poll is more indicative of people disliking their dysfunctional government . The reason that the number is that high is due to his base supporting his policy positions , regardless of his ability to implement them . He can simply blame republicans , and as long as republicans continue a political strategy that makes them appear that they 're not willing to compromise , he can call them a bully , and continue to have high polling numbers .
Why would they champion it ? Anyways , there is a key difference , you and your wife . Losing a child do to miscarriage and aborting is not the same ( for the parents ) .
I ca n't blame him . It 's free money for his economy . It 's about like the massive number of people who are against FEMA , yet do whatever they can to collect from it . To them it 's simply getting `` their '' money back for a program they do n't want to pay for .
Operation Christmas Child . I remember going with my youth group all the way up to Minnesota to sort out things that could n't be sent ( war toys , gum , etc . ) , and we 'd all act like we were going for the children 's sake , when in reality it was so we could go to mall of america .
`` The Papal Octopus '' would be such a cool band name .

During my lifetime the end of the world has been predicted with absolute certainty 63 times . I 'm 45 .
Meals on Wheels , not food stamps . Misleading as fuck .
They want the government shut down and they want the Republicans to bear the responsibility . The MSM will do their best to make sure that happens .
You have to look at it this way as well . A lot of those representatives are for completely rural areas that are heavily against obamacare and their reps are doing exactly what their constituents are telling them . A majority of Americans may not agree but that 's what the house is for . Protecting the rights of people not in the majority .
I would be interested in seeing how this information was collected . Nowhere in the article or the poll results is that information given .
Again . /While I have your attention is the video he made for the police . He seems mild mannered enough in this video but if you read the article you can see he can become quite violent under the right circumstances . If this article is true and he forced someone out of their home with a gun he is probably going to jail this time . I will post updates as they come along .
THERE ARE MURDERERS WHO GOT OFF EASIER THAN THAT .
from the article : `` So , if rich people do not create the jobs , what does ? A healthy economic ecosystem — one in which most participants ( the middle class ) have plenty of money to spend. `` and `` We 're all in this together . And until we understand that , our economy is going to go nowhere. `` But no real ideas on how to change anything ...
Are you surprised ? It 's Mother Jones .
Pamphlet transitions into Malcolm In The Middle Theme : `` I do n't know ... can you repeat the question ? You 're not the lord of me now ! You 're not the lord of me now ! You 're not the lord of me now and you 're not so real ! `` Psych , it was an Atheism pamphlet .

For the others who have no idea what the fuck intransigent means : Intransigent 1. unwilling or refusing to change one 's views or to agree about something .
As a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania this does n't surprise me . We may be in the north east of the country but our government acts like they 're from the deep south .
tl ; dr : the American Family Association , a rabidly homophobic hate group , is spewing falsehoods about the American Psychiatric Association . It is unclear whether this is because AFA staff is genuinely incompetent or illiterate , downright delusional , or just plain deliberately lying , but all three are easily possible . I 'm disgusted the linked website seriously describes the AFA , a hate group , as a well trusted christian media source .
Ca n't stand Ayn Rand , never understood her appeal , she reminds me of the wicked witch . Selfishness is the opposite of virtue , indeed it is the root of all evil . In what way does she promote or retain traditional social institutions ? How is she `` conservative ? ``
& gt ; focused on creating a product instead That actually is not true at all . A 'product ' is something to be sold . As it stands now , the media is crucial to the top 1 % not as a 'product ' but as a means of control of the population and keeping the discontented silent by either giving them no voice or making them look scary and/or ridiculous and/or mentally ill .

Is the same sponge bob that they were hating on for climate change a few years ago ?
As a progressive service member that is constantly reminded of the oppressive attitude towards homosexuals in the military , this makes me feel sufficiently relieved .
Back in 2000 , during the Napster days , few people seemed to realized this . I think of it as a game changing revelation . There used to be a general assumption if you offer the media on the web it was guaranteed to be stolen , which inevitably would destroy your business model . I do n't know why so few people realized convenience is far more powerful motivator than price ( or lack of price ) . It just did n't seem to dawn on many of us in the industry at the time .
Correlation does not imply causation .
not to be a buzzkill , but you can bet the vast majority of those veterans voted republican , and will continue to do so . you ca n't make the weather then complain when it rains . the GOP agenda parted ways with their so-called ideology a long time ago . anyone , and i mean anyone , making less than $ 750,000 a year that votes republican today is a bona fide idiot . they need to stop voting a party line and start voting for the party that really represents their interests .

The Xbone is going to get pummeled by this thing .
What she said is that he held meetings in his whitehouse with individuals who wanted borders set a specific way in Israel so that the borders complied with the bible 's requirements for the apocalypse . Is that true or false ?
The fact that partisan battles are still able to cripple our country is what amazes me . The Father of Our Country , George Washington , While parties are necessary to provide a layer of checks and balances , we 've let them stall the progress of our country far too much . Especially lately .
To be sure , we do need someone in the senate like Warren to goad legislation in the proper direction . That 's something that a president has limited power to effect . OTOH , there is no one else on the scene presently that can be trusted to the singularly important job of President .
Money shot from the end : & gt ; The virgin birth : Mary probably made up the story of God impregnating her so that she would not be an outcast or stoned to death for being a teenage , unwed mother . She could have been raped by a Roman soldier or some other pervert as were thousands of young women . Back then , the women were penalized more than the rapists . She could have just told a big lie and started Christianity . She would have had to tell Jesus that he was the son of God to keep the lie going , so he grew up really believing God was his father . Jesus was not lying when he said he was the son of God , because he just believed what his mother told him . This inspired him and connected him to the collective unconscious , what he called the Holy Spirit . This gave him the ability to channel all the truth that he did . He looked for the truth in the present , because he believed God , his father , would try to communicate with him . Just thinking this opened up the door to the universal mind and the truth and the life . Jesus was very open-minded and brave . TL ; DR : Believes the Jesus story is a myth , but that the Bible still holds truth . I 'm going to pass .
He 's still on the air ?
If you actually bothered listening to him , you would know that he does n't criticize the rich for making money , but for attempting to set up the system to ensure that they stay as wealthy as possible , while those that are not rich can not move up . There is nothing wrong with being a Warren Buffett and making billions , if you do n't spend a chunk of that making sure that you do n't have to pay taxes , and destroying the system that allows for social mobility .
As an Australian , seeing this headline gave me hardcore deja vu . Torytard conservatives here just gutted our NBN project on behalf of Murdoch and Telstra . Ugh ... Capitalism fail fail fail ...
The whole point of wikipedia is not to approach editing with a specific political or ideological motivation . It seems that revisionism is the nature of progressivism -- the idea that the old normative methods are inherently bad and thus must be changed for the sake of change .
How many of these people support the Commander should stay the deciding person to keep good order in the ranks ?
You know , normally when superheroes ( other than Batman ) get a vehicle it is poorly done attempt to cash in on some merchandising deal . If you really want a vehicle that will definitely take you to a destination where the roads do n't go , so that you can get some serious work done there , you should get a Unimog . It lacks comfort and tends to look ugly but if you want to fjord rivers , climb mountains driver through a forest , the desert or the frozen tundra or maybe just want to use your car as a train engine on a shunting yard it is definitely the one you want .
Consider that 62 % of US bankruptcies are due to medical bills . Also consider that 80 % of those actually HAD insurance . The crappy kind that the Right wants people to keep if they like it .
This is another `` creationist '' ploy - the bible says that it is n't a disease , so just ignore it . Sad , these two idiots who have never serve a day in the military or viewed up close and personal the actual horror of war / death , sit at home and tell soldiers how to feel . I 'm sure the family and friends of those who are suffering from PTSD would disagree with these idiots . It is only because that there is now a term for it - that it can be used by faux religious zealots - ignoring all those who had the same symptoms after serving in other wars - as they could only self-medicate .

And here I am in the corner , hoping Neil Tyson steps up . Maybe not for a presidential bid , not yet , but his work as an education advocate and science promoter is desperately needed to counter some of the more extreme attacks on us . Rational thinking helps our side .
The democrats keep shooting themselves in the foot . Do they not know they will be out of the Senate come election time ? Almost everyone that drank the grape kool-aid is starting to wake up to the phony Democrats that have done so much harm to America in a short 5 years .

If you think your legislator is too conservative , look to replace him in the primary . If you don ’ t manage to do it , just think about what the Republican House just did , and put your shoulder to the wheel .
Not sensationalist enough , only whinefests and victimhood sells in the media these days . Any success stories are spread by 'OFA ' and 'Obama ' shills .
A few of my friends and I joined Google+ when it first launched but we just thought there was no use for it because hardly anyone we know was on it and everyone 's on Facebook anyway . I think they screwed up a bit with the circles feature . Yes it 's a great concept and it 's dead simple , but I must admit , when I first joined , it did take me a little while to wrap my head around how it worked . It 's a common principle in user experience design not to make the user think ( ) and from my experience , I 've found Google breaks that principle a fair bit , which I think is one of their biggest weaknesses . But to be fair , they are also great at creating simple/clean interfaces at times as well . It 's nice to have advanced features , but unfortunately , if they want to find their place is the social networking market , they need to appeal to the lowest common denominator .
Good . Split the RINO vote in the primaries .

& gt ; Of course , the Obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout , but there are other culprits getting less attention – namely , global tech conglomerate CGI , which was responsible for the bulk of the execution , and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayer-funded contracts without enough accountability . & gt ; Government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades . Taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies ' pockets , about $ 80bn of which goes to tech companies . We 've reached a stage of knee-jerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias , and it 's damaging in multiple levels . & gt ; For one thing , farming work out often rips off taxpayers . While the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent , time-wasters drooling over their Texas Instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions , studies show that keeping government services in house saves money . In fact , contractor billing rates average an astonishing 83 % more than what it would cost to do the work in-house . Hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the US , while contractors , especially in the IT space , can ship taxpayer-funded work overseas . & gt ; Fortunately , then , there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers ' collective expense , and it is time we used them ...

And GAP and Old Navy got me to shop there for Christmas presents for girls .

Now here is the thing : `` Church '' is n't a building or a geographical area . It 's something we can forget some times , but I 'm sure we have all heard that before . Another thing people misunderstand and does n't get enough attention is that `` church '' is n't an event either . Catch-phrases like this can serve a purpose , but they can also distract us from proper definitions , and in this case , proper ecclesiology . The Church is the body of believers .

The reason they was n't encrypted was because this was on an online service that allowed people access to their bitcoins whenever they wanted , so the private keys had to always be accessible server-side . From a tech point , what they stole is control of the coins registed in the Bitcoin protocol 's distributed ledger . They managed to get the site owner 's private ECDSA cryptographic keys and used them to sign a Bitcoin transaction to the thief 's own Bitcoin address .
A copy of your wallet after your bitcoins have been stolen is like a photograph of your coins after someone took your money .
I agree with the premise of this article , but I would reply with , why ca n't we have both ? Why ca n't we have scripture knowledge and purity along with love and humility ? I think it 's dangerous to take an `` it 's all good '' approach to religion , because scripture is very clear to avoid false prophets and teachers , as they can lead us astray . I actually would venture to say that scriptural knowledge leads us to love and humility .
One more time : People have rights . Governments do not have rights , governments have powers granted to them by the people .
And people who understand math .
They 're just pissing and moaning that someone told them `` no '' .
unfortunately , it 's the right wing that 's more likely to invoke christianity or relgion in general , so they kinda have a certain ownership of it .
Forgot to mention in the title , this is an x-post from /r/BasicIncome

Same here . The verdict is as sad as it is predictable .

How to force a 25 % pay cut , and not have any full time employees that need benefits . Fuck everything about this idea .
I do n't think you really did the Lutheran view of Law and Gospel justice . What I essentially see you saying is `` the law is old testament , and does n't apply to us anymore. `` That 's not how Law and Gospel works for us Lutherans .
Reid is a lying sack of a hypocrite . Boy are you Dems gon na regret this once the Republicans regain control again .
She 's `` quiet '' ? I 've seen so many more news stories about Warren than about Hilary in recent years .

Yes , but can it run Minecraft on far ?
Fox news and it 's viewers have been on a sinking island void of anything intellectual for years now . This is n't news .
Yeah I have to say as a moderate that if I saw this slideshow it would shift me to the right . There are useful and detrimental forms of biblical criticism . Your slide glibly defends them all by painting your opponents as all representing a single position ( literalism ) and arguing criticism is superior . Well as a moderate i 'm no literalist , but depending what criticism you are talking about , it sure is preferable ! Law and Gospel is spread throughout both testaments , sometimes within the same verse , your slide shows a complete misunderstanding of Walther and therefore Lutheranism . Furthermore , to write off a part of the cannon is Marcionism ( an ancient heresy ) wikipedia . org/wiki/Marcionism Remember that your pro life brethren understand abortion to be murder . If you want to try to convince them you are going to need an argument where you can replace the word `` abortion '' for `` murder '' in the argument and it will still be persuasive . I 'm not saying you have to believe it 's murder , I 'm saying you have to know your audience . Actually the issue of homosexuality is not remotely controversial in places where the church is growing like East Asia and North Africa . It 's a major issue in the US and Europe . Try again without writing off 70 % of all Christians in your answer . There are two sides to the final argument , you miss both of them , and presume the problem is that they do n't understand the way to accomplish a liberal political agenda is through liberalism . Side 1 : The political causes I think are most important are things like addiction recovery , missions to closed countries , and family values , consistent with all the things you named , but represented in this country by the opposite political party as the one this church is supporting . Side 2 : I do n't think the church institution should be supporting any political agenda at all , I think that is a job for Christians , but not churches , the church has lost focus on the important things ( like the sacraments )
this it what burns my ass about this country , this is still going on and yet we send billions of dollars to all these assholes around the world who hate us ! foreign aid my ass ! lets feed our own first ! now i am all pissed off ! i 'm done !
`` Remember all those angry lectures that Obamacare was settled law ? The Democrats said , `` It 's the law of the land . You ca n't change it. `` Well , so much for that . So much for the rule of law . So much for constitutional republicanism .

For proper evaluation , we also need Christian tape and Muslim tape . If Christian tape is lost less than neutral control ...
The holiday is not President 's Day . It 's George Washington 's Birthday .
Sort of a `` Read my lips , no new taxes. `` GHW Bush moment for Obama .
Unfortunately voters have a short memory . The GOP bastards would never dream of pulling this shit 1 month before a congressional election .
He is n't a poor minority or illegal alien . Obamacare was n't designed to help him . I wonder if this story will ever make it to r/politics where they hail Obumacare as the best thing since welfare .
Making 'class warfare ' seem like a bad thing was one of the smartest things rich people ever did .

Welcome to the world if southern Baptists . Nasty people .
I do like how Anderson Cooper tries to defend Obama by saying that Laszewski has been opposed to Obamacare and that the White House is calling it preposterous .
I 'm always amazed at how willing liberals are to admit that they agree with `` the ends justifies the means '' .
It 's ok. Shit is n't a word you should be concerned about . Here 's a story ... Someone , somewhere , sometime decided to create a new word that means the same as `` poop '' , but is n't `` poop '' . They started using it , and then more people started using it , and then someone decided they were going to be offended by it . This person then created a rule somewhere that this word is bad . And then more people began following the rule , and eventually it became a societal norm to believe that `` shit '' was a BAD word , even though it literally means `` poop '' , and saying it was a sin . If it 's not in the bible , friend , I would n't consider it a sin , or even something bad . It 's just a word that someone else decided you could n't say .
Same here in CO. No issues .
I got into it in a thread and said just this ... and you should have seen the hate and vitriol . Every comment was calling me a liar . It was truly amazing to see how angry socialists get when you call out the awful past their ideology has .
The TPP is a knockout blow to US manufacturing ; in its beaten state idk if US manufacturing can make a comeback .

yup .. if they really didnt think it would work , they should it pass .. and let it `` fail '' ... they would get the house , senate and presidency .
The really important question is why the fuck do we keep talking about Limbaugh ?
Amen to that .
Heheheheheheheh
Thank you for this . I have 3 children , 4 , 2 , and 2 weeks old and sometimes I wonder if I should stay home and watch mass instead of bringing my `` distractions. `` We have a crying room , and if one of them act up my wife and I will take them their until they calm down . This gives me a new prespective and is very encouraging .
Abused how ?
Even though their support is at an all time low , their press coverage , and funding , will not be .
Aggregate dollar amount does not equal votes . You are just as likely to vote for the candidate you donated $ 1 to as you are to the candidate you maxed out your donation on . Super PACs only have so much impact- see Karl Rove 's Super PACs , and Mitt Romney losing the last presidential election . There is no significant impact of money in an election . The way I see it , the problems ( by problems , I mean extreme wing politicians , ie the handful of Tea Partiers in Congress that have currently hijacked the federal government ) that we face come from the primary process . Primary elections only have the most extreme or fringe members of their party voting , which is why we wind up with these candidates . But there is hope . Here 's how YOU can change outcomes : register with a party and show up to ALL elections ! ! Encourage your state to have open primaries ! ! Get off reddit and get out there and sign petitions , volunteer , get your message out .
They know it wo n't stand up in court . That 's not the point . The goal is to bankrupt existing abortion providers while hey fight this law .
Pretty much the same here . I remember when Bitcoins went above $ 10 ( I think they even peaked at around $ 30 ) and stayed there for a while , but then dropped to around $ 4-5 . Back then there was a lot of discussion on Bitcoin forums whether it would be a good investment to just buy a bunch of Bitcoins and sit on them , hoping that their price would increase . The general consensus was pretty much : `` nah , you might double your money in a few years if you 're lucky , but that 's about it '' . Who would have thought that you could profit 1000 % in just a couple of years ? ( IIRC , I have about 0 . 16BTC in my wallet acquired by mining ( have n't used Bitcoin in ages ) and back when I earned that , it was n't really worth anything , but apparently now even that would be worth around $ 80 . Crazy . )
Yup , also I hate the whole `` Purchase out movie on our system ... oh yea , you can only use our special player to use it '' . That is my main complaint with DRM . I do n't want to be restricted to certain devices and such .
Treasonous .
This is really upsetting .
Fuck all the speculation until we see a video .
This is Portland , Maine , everybody . Though I 'd now surmise that Portland , Oregon might be at 70+ percent .
I love how they at the end , they pull out a stuck Hummer .
Perhaps they are confusing God with cherry picked pieces of the bible ? If they literally think god spoke to them directly I am really rather scared .
Fucking a guys , the only reason we have been winning elections is because we appear normal compared to the Tea Party . I do n't necessarily like Clinton but she would win 2016 ensuring that the Supreme court would be dominated by Liberals for the foreseeable future . It would be easier for a liberal Supreme court to overrule previous rulings like Citizen United than it would for Congress , which will remain divided due to the Republican gerrymandering of crucial swing states that allow them to hold the House despite losing the popular vote . The greatest strength Republicans had until 2010 was that they fell in line . This is what Democrats have done since then and it has allowed us to hold the Presidency along with the Senate . Elizabeth Warren is to the Democrats as Ted Cruz is to the Republicans ; they represent the the beliefs of the base but do not reflect the attitudes of the general electorate which , despite Obama 's election and reelection , remains centre-right . All she would do is hurt Hillary in the Primary by forcing Hillary to move further to the left just as Santorum and Gingrich forced Romney to move further and further to the right . Winning the 2016 election is all that matters . Fall in line . The day will come when we can elect a candidate like Senator Warren but it is not this day . Do n't confuse me for a moderate as I fall into the British School of Economics and would like nothing more than to see a re-implementation of New Deal fiscal policy but our current political climate will not allow that and losing the presidency would allow Republicans to cut more programs than we are seeing now with Obama . We have to hold the line . Look at the big picture .
The Cooch had a huge lead at first , and I was freaking terrified that we 'd be stuck with Ken American Taliban Cuccinelli for four years , leading to all sorts of anti-abortion , anti-health-care , and anti-LGBT-rights nonsense . Thank goodness the DC suburbs saved us ! ! !
Ca n't access the site anyway ; it says the security certificate has been revoked .
People are starting to be a lot more divisive with their beliefs , that 's for sure . It is n't dying .
I 'm an ardent Leftist but I agree with him . The moral relativism amongst my friends often descends into abstract lunacy with few people willing to definitively condemn or support anything for fear of offending someone else or being excoriated themselves . The Left eats its own in my experience just as well as the Right does , with many desiring to make their reputations on the bloody husks of colleagues who were not `` left enough '' in a culture of shaming and ridicule that can be painful to watch .
& gt ; I own a home worth about $ 175,000 ... my school and property taxes are $ 8,000 per year Holy shit ! I thought property taxes were bad ! $ 200k home with property taxes of $ 4,000 per year ( but we live in a small town in Central IL ) . That 's insane !
& gt ; I wish someone would call him on it on camera . Here 's something else I was they 'd call him on . In all previous government shut downs , the fight was over the budget and proposed spending . It was never about a bill that was passed by congress and signed into law by the president . Now what he is doing is thwarting the democratic process by trying to undo legislation that his party does n't like by using extortion . Why does Boehner think he 's no longer bound by the usual democratic process ? I 'd like to hear the answer to that question .
This is also the kind of shit that 'll be on r/cringepics
Doubt is what destroys lukewarmness . We should be either hot or cold , and that is what doubt accomplishes . As you said , it either causes you to search and find your answers and make you on fire for your faith , or you realize you did n't believe it in the first place , and grow cold .
This is why it infuriates me when people on Reddit use that tired old comment about atheists being `` just as bad '' as religious zealots . Really ? ? ? ? & gt ; Witch Killings : & gt ; Enoch Adeboye is an evangelical pastor from Nigeria who promotes the existence of witches and wizards , resulting in the torture and death of young children and others in Nigeria , the wider African continent , and has also spread into Europe . ( See Ref1 ) & gt ; On Christmas Day , 2010 , 15-year-old Kristy Bamu was found by paramedics in the bathroom of an East London high-rise flat . His body had been mutilated , teeth were missing , and he was covered in deep cuts and bruising . He had been starved and deprived of water and sleep , punched and kicked repeatedly , floor tiles smashed over his head , his teeth knocked out with a hammer , and a pair of pliers had been used to twist his ear . In the last four days of his life , he had suffered acts of unspeakable savagery , viciously inflicted upon him by a man he called `` uncle '' and one of his own sisters . & gt ; Why ? & gt ; Because Eric Bikubi and Magalie Bamu , the boy ’ s family members , were convinced that he was a “ witch ” . Debbie Ariyo , executive director of Africans Unite Against Child Abuse ... explains that a boom in Pentecostal churches was leading to more children being accused of witchcraft . & gt ; An average of eight children a year in Greater London are victims of abuse based on witchcraft-style exorcisms , but this only reflects cases resulting in police investigations . According to UK Church Statistics , 670 Pentecostal churches opened between 2005 and 2010 , taking the total to 3,900 - that figure is expected to rise to 4,600 by 2015 . As a result , Ariyo fears that `` witch-branding '' will increase . & gt ; '' It is spreading like bushfire because it is a source of income , '' says Ariyo . `` If you can charge £500 for an oil that is going to 'cure ' a child of evil spirits , you are going to make money. `` & gt ; Whilst Adeboye 's primary aim may be to exert power over his congregation and to extort money from relatives for cures , many people take the matter into their own hands . His preaching will increase the likelihood of people in a segment of the Australian community being accused of witchcraft by radical evangelicals . Subsequently , this will increase the chance of acts of torture and murder being committed like the case in the UK , referred to above . & gt ; If torture and murder are the result of this sort of evangelical preaching in a developed Western nation like England , then there is every reason to expect heinous acts to be committed here if the Australian government grants access to this man known for hate-mongering , acts of evil and causing great harm to others . ( See Ref2,3,4,5,6 and 12 ) & gt ; Anti- Homosexuals : & gt ; Adeboye is currently campaigning , from the pulpit , for a proposed Nigerian law making Same Sex Marriage an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison . Additionally , he is increasing the danger to anyone seen as being ‘ pro-gay ’ , potentially causing journalists to be too afraid to report the truth . In effect ( if not intentionally ) Adeboyes campaigning will essentially lead to the outlawing of organizations that provide services for gay people , including HIV/AIDS clinics . & gt ; The Nigerian anti-gay law has already been passed by both Houses of Parliament . In addition to criminalising Same Sex Marriage , it also punishes public displays of same sex affection by up to ten years jail . The bill is only awaiting the President 's signature to become law . & gt ; The U. S. ambassador to Nigeria has said that Enoch Adeboye is not in line with international human rights laws . & gt ; There are serious concerns in the Australian community that some of Adeboye ’ s ignorant , vulnerable congregation will interpret what he is saying ( `` Same-sex marriage is an anathema to the will of God '' ) to mean that it is ‘ god 's will ’ for them to rid the world of homosexuals . ( See Ref7,8 and 9 )
I wonder how much of this is a natural progression of both parties playing an ever more brutal game . Obama is more closed than Bush who was more closed than Clinton ... and whoever follows Obama I 'll be an even bigger control freak .
When you 've seen how angry and violent the religious groups are , it makes sense to want no association with them .
I still maintain a percentage of the population is genetically prone to religion . While controversial , it explains how educated people who know better still ca n't shake it . For anyone who asks , provided you understand how evolution works : What happens to the population when you spend thousands of years systematically killing anyone who tells you they do n't believe in your god ( s ) ?
Wow , if you got fox news there is no mention of this . Fox news does not even talk about the shutdown anywhere on their site . The closest they come they say something called a slim down , but that makes no sense . So fox news is ignoring the main political story right now about the shutdown .
Welcome to the new congress , same as the old congress ....
It was still an incredibly lucrative investment for the Kochs . I 'm sure they made a fucking killing from the total chaos it created in our government and the ( hopefully ) temporary destruction of protections for the middle and lower classes from a total corporate takeover . Mission absolutely accomplished .
So apparently Catholics are n't Christians according to this pamphlet .
Could you image how poor of a state they would be , without `` city folks '' tax money ?
The most amazing part of that episode was when they brought up Islam . Is was amazing : the three religious-sympathiser Libs were saying all religions were equal regarding the ability to encourage violence ( which is facially absurd ) , & amp ; Al Sharpton threw in the typical , stupid , `` & amp ; atheists too '' comment ... then Bill brought the statistics about Muslims ' support for outlawing criticism of Islam in Britain to the table , & amp ; the three people were going mad . They were getting irritable & amp ; saying 'but what about America ' , & amp ; , 'surely Christianity is just as bad as Islam ' ( in the vein of this Post Modern 'everything is equal ' nonsense ) ... then Bills totally goes on a tangent ... out of the blue he starts talking about a film , & amp ; the three of them get happy again , they 're laughing & amp ; agreeing & amp ; saying how absurd the US military is ... But then ... Richard Dawkins , uninterested in Hollywood , goes back to the hard facts : he says , `` but it 's not just Americans they 're after [ in revenge for foreign policy ] : a lot of British Muslims support killing fellow Muslims for leaving Islam '' ... they 're all caught off guard , Al is like , `` ok , so what do we do about it ? `` Michael Moore is frustrated & amp ; get sarcastic & amp ; says , `` ok , but , so what , should we kill them all ? `` ... the answer is just use Liberalism ; stand by Liberalism & amp ; do n't be afraid of criticising Islam . It was like a brief moment those statistics actually resonated with people who did n't like them .
Why only spending cuts ? Include subsidy slashes and across the board tax increases , especially for corporations . Then see how quickly Republicans come running to the table .
Because it 's Texas . The place where they slip creationism into textbooks .
I have a feeling the ACA will be that little taste of actual health care that makes the American Public say fuck it , I want Universal Healthcare .
& gt ; secrete rulings That explains a lot .
I thought this was even more impressive : & gt ; She is outspoken and controversial . She lost a domain to the Libyan Government , was famously yelled at by Steve Jobs , was the locus of Google 's nymwars , and was the first female podcaster .
Benefits : - Fewer Drug Enforcement officers needed , can focus on solving more serious crime - Taxes of business and sales - Most of the marijuana related offenders in the prison population can be released - Marijuana smell may no longer be used as probable cause in searches Cons : - State may have to provide Farm subsidy 's and / or crop insurance which may decrease total tax revenue . - State drug enforcement agents may be out of a job - Police and Prisons may decrease employment as well due to less inmates - Marijuana smell may no longer be used as probable cause in searches
Check out the comment section on this video on youtube . watch ? v=kx1jPTFBlfg The son ( Nicolas Samples ) of the preacher ( Angela Cummings ) is arguing with her . Incidentally , she has a youtube channel where she uploads her `` sermons '' .
Single payer healthcare works great where I live . Americans should n't be afraid to try something different . Universal healthcare for all Americans !

This would make me so happy . It sounds like they might move him to a later spot though . Honestly if they were smart they 'd just drop him .
While Dick is an ass hat , it is generally considered to be in the interest of national security to keep the President and Vice President healthy . A VP not accepting these surgeries on moral grounds would be potentially hazardous in other ways . Now , he could have paid for them on his own , but the US government has a vested interest in keeping him alive . Also , taking advantage of what is available , while still not believing it should be available , does n't necessarily make him a bad person . `` Would you like some free ice cream ? `` `` I do n't think you should be giving out free ice cream , but yes I 'm hot and need to cool down and would love some free ice cream. `` There is an unlimited amount of things to hate him for , focusing on this is silly .
Something I read earlier today : & gt ; ... conservatives rooting for its demise have been expressing not just vindication , but triumph . `` We could be looking at the collapse of American liberalism , '' said columnist Charles Krauthammer . `` Liberalism is crumbling in front of our eyes , '' echoed Michele Bachmann . & gt ; That 's a little like proclaiming that your team will inevitably lose the World Series , then go bankrupt and disband because the other team scored a run in the first inning of Game 1 .
This was what folks did n't understand about the last raise on incomes over $ 400k ( and the Pubbies exploited to the hilt ) .
At least the New York Post is telling the truth .
Edit : I 'll preface with this : The title and article linked above is a misconception of most progressives because : ( Most ) republicans are believers in the Free Market . I may get nuked for this , but the Tea Partiers/conservatives/republicans do n't have a plan because no plan is necessary . Because if you remove the laws holding back entrepreneurs from starting a business , they will 'fill the hole ' with a service/product at competitive prices , because others will be offering same/similar product/services . This competition is what drive prices down . Customers voting with their money . It 's a perfect example of the argument of Centralized planning & amp ; control vs. free market . One of the arguments for years is that if insurance companies could ( in the past ) have offered plans nation-wide , rather then limited by state borders , the dollar cost averaging of health care would have been more effective . anyway , my 2 cents .
This is an interesting point . There are no shortcuts in materials engineering . Cheap 3D printers may be great for prototyping and for soft materials , e. g. in the range of plastic up to lighter structural metals . But some kind of tools requires specific materials , that requires very specific processing that may be hazardous ( high temperatures , fumes , toxic byproducts ) and costly ( energy , short lifespan of machinery when working hard parts , long post production testing ... ) . If 3D printing is the silver bullet for an industrial process , I expect the first ones to embrace it being professional operators , where any edge over competitors means millions , and I expect some delay ( if ever ) for the process being accessible for general purpose low cost equipment . And , last but not least , I do n't expect a single process , even if flexible and advanced as 3D printing , to be ever able to replace any other kind of specialized processing . Molding , laser cutting , welding , machining ... each single process is more effective in its context .
Maybe you mean how we are to respond to the gospel ? Or how the gospel affects us and gives us salvation ? I mean the basic gospel is the life , death , resurrection , and ascension of Jesus Christ and R. Catholics definitely see that the same as any other Christian .

Does anybody remember during one of the debates how Obama said he was proud to call it `` Obamacare '' ?
